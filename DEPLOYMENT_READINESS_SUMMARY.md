### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocking Issues** (Must Fix Before Launch)

#### 1. **Documentation Organization** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem**: 48+ markdown files scattered across project  
**Impact**: Confusing for customers who buy SaaStastic  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Solution**: Created `DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` with complete reorganization plan

**Action Items**:
- Move session summaries to `docs/sessions/`
- Move old planning docs to `docs/archived/`
- Consolidate duplicate documentation
- Create `docs/README.md` as master index
- Keep only 5-6 files at root level

---

#### 2. **Environment Configuration** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Problem**: No `.env.example` file for customers  
**Impact**: Customers won't know what environment variables to set  
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DONE** - Created `.env.example` with all required variables

**What It Includes**:
- All required services (Database, Clerk, Stripe)
- All optional services (Sentry, Upstash, Resend)
- Clear comments explaining each variable
- Security best practices
- Setup instructions

---

#### 3. **Service Setup Guide** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Customers need step-by-step instructions for setting up each service  
**Impact**: Customers won't be able to deploy without this  
**Time**: 1-2 hours

**Needs to Include**:
- **Required Services**:
  - How to sign up for Clerk
  - How to get Clerk API keys
  - How to set up Stripe account
  - How to configure Stripe webhooks
  - How to set up PostgreSQL database
  
- **Optional Services**:
  - How to enable/disable Sentry
  - How to use Upstash or alternatives
  - How to replace Resend with other email providers
  - What happens if you don't configure optional services

**Recommended Location**: `docs/getting-started/service-setup-guide.md`

---

#### 4. **Manual Testing** üî¥ REQUIRED
**Problem**: Some testing can't be automated  
**Impact**: May have UI issues on different devices/browsers  
**Time**: 4 hours total

**Testing Checklist**:

**a) Responsive Design** (1 hour)
- Test on desktop (1920x1080, 1366x768)
- Test on tablet (1024x768, 768x1024)
- Test on mobile (375x667, 414x896)
- **How**: Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Device Toolbar (F12)
- **What to check**: Navigation, forms, tables, buttons

**b) Browser Compatibility** (1 hour)
- Chrome (latest) - ‚úÖ Already tested via Playwright
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (Mac/iOS)
- Edge (latest)
- **How**: Open app in each browser, test critical flows

**c) Accessibility** (1 hour)
- Keyboard navigation (Tab key)
- Color contrast ratios
- Screen reader friendly (test with NVDA/VoiceOver)
- Focus indicators visible
- **How**: Lighthouse audit + manual keyboard testing

**d) Manual Subscription Tests** (1 hour)
- Upgrade subscription (from Starter to Professional)
- Downgrade subscription (from Professional to Starter)
- Cancel subscription
- **Why**: These require waiting for Stripe webhooks (can't automate easily)
- **How**: See `docs/testing/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

---

### üü° **Recommended** (Should Do Before Launch)

#### 1. **Fix ESLint Warnings** (1-2 hours)
**Current**: 55 warnings  
**Target**: <10 warnings  
**Impact**: Code quality, not functionality  
**Risk**: LOW - doesn't prevent deployment

**Breakdown**:
- ~30 unused variables/imports - Safe to fix
- ~15 React hook dependencies - Review carefully
- ~10 misc (img tags, etc.) - Safe to fix

**Action**: `npm run lint` ‚Üí Fix warnings one by one

---

#### 2. **Update Dependencies** (1 hour)
**Current**: 22 packages have updates available  
**Risk**: LOW - current versions work fine

**Priority Order**:
1. **Security patches** (do first):
   - @clerk/nextjs: 6.33.1 ‚Üí 6.33.3
   - @sentry/nextjs: 10.17.0 ‚Üí 10.18.0
   - @prisma/client: 6.16.3 ‚Üí 6.17.0

2. **Standard updates**:
   - Next.js: 15.5.0 ‚Üí 15.5.4
   - React: 19.1.0 ‚Üí 19.2.0
   - Stripe: 19.0.0 ‚Üí 19.1.0

3. **Test frameworks** (careful - breaking changes):
   - Vitest: 2.1.9 ‚Üí 3.2.4 (MAJOR version, test after)
   - Playwright: 1.55.1 ‚Üí 1.56.0 (safe)

**Action**: `npm update` for patches, then test thoroughly

---

#### 3. **Run Lighthouse Audit** (30 minutes)
**Why**: Identify performance and accessibility issues  
**How**: Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Lighthouse tab ‚Üí Generate report  
**Target**: All scores > 90

---

### üü¢ **Non-Blocking** (Can Launch Without)

#### 1. **npm audit Vulnerabilities** (LOW RISK)
**Status**: 7 moderate vulnerabilities  
**Location**: Dev dependencies only (vitest/esbuild)  
**Impact**: None - not in production bundle  
**Action**: Can fix by upgrading vitest 2.x ‚Üí 3.x (breaking change)  
**Recommendation**: Safe to launch, fix after if you want

---

#### 2. **TypeScript Errors** (ACCEPTABLE)
**Status**: 5 errors total  
**Breakdown**:
- 2 in `.next/types/` (Next.js generated, can't fix)
- 3 in test files (type casting for mocks, standard practice)
**Source Code**: 100% clean ‚úÖ  
**Action**: None needed - acceptable for production

---

#### 3. **Performance Optimization** (POST-LAUNCH)
All performance optimization should be done AFTER launch with real usage data:
- Bundle size analysis
- Image optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies

**Why wait**: Don't over-optimize prematurely. Real user data tells you what actually needs optimization.

## üîë Key Questions Answered

### **Q: Does SaaStastic ship with API keys?**
**A**: NO. Customers must get their own subscriptions to:
- Clerk (authentication) - REQUIRED
- Stripe (payments) - REQUIRED  
- PostgreSQL database - REQUIRED
- Sentry (error tracking) - OPTIONAL
- Upstash (rate limiting) - OPTIONAL
- Resend (email) - OPTIONAL

### **Q: Can customers opt out of optional services?**
**A**: YES! Simply don't set the environment variables:
- **Sentry**: Leave `SENTRY_DSN` blank or remove package
- **Upstash**: Leave `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` blank or implement alternative
- **Resend**: Leave `RESEND_API_KEY` blank or use different email provider

### **Q: What about the build errors I see?**
**A**: The 5 TypeScript errors are acceptable:
- 2 errors in Next.js auto-generated files (can't fix, Next.js issue)
- 3 errors in test files (intentional type casting for mocks)
- Production build completes successfully with warnings only
- All warnings are cosmetic (unused variables, etc.)

### **Q: Are the npm vulnerabilities a problem?**
**A**: NO for production deployment:
- All 7 vulnerabilities are in dev dependencies only
- Not included in production bundle
- Only affect local development/testing
- Can be fixed post-launch by upgrading vitest

### **Q: How do we test UI/UX requirements?**
**A**: Mix of automated and manual:
- **Automated**: Playwright E2E tests (Chrome only), Lighthouse audit
- **Manual**: Responsive design, other browsers, keyboard navigation
- **Total time**: ~4 hours for comprehensive manual testing
- **See**: `docs/testing/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
