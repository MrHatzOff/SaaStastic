  // FAQ items
  faq: [
    {
      question: "What is multi-tenancy?",
      answer: "Multi-tenancy allows multiple customers (tenants) to use the same application while keeping their data completely isolated and secure. Each tenant has their own workspace but shares the same underlying infrastructure."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is the data isolation?",
      answer: "We implement tenant isolation at multiple layers: database queries are automatically scoped by tenant ID, API endpoints validate tenant access, and middleware enforces company context throughout the application."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the application?",
      answer: "Absolutely! The boilerplate is designed to be highly customizable. You can modify the branding, add new features, integrate with external services, and adapt it to your specific business needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What technologies are included?",
      answer: "The stack includes Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Clerk authentication, and many other modern tools for building scalable SaaS applications."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide support?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer different levels of support depending on your plan. From community support for starter plans to dedicated 24/7 support for enterprise customers."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started?",
      answer: "Simply sign up for an account, choose your plan, and follow our quick start guide. You can have your SaaS application running in minutes with our pre-configured boilerplate."
