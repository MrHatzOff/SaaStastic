## 🔴 Critical Items Before Launch (6-8 hours)

**YOU MUST COMPLETE THESE BEFORE STARTING DAY 1 OF LAUNCH PLAN**

### ⚠️ Read This First: `PRE_LAUNCH_CRITICAL_TASKS.md`

**Two critical features missing**:

1. **Stripe Customer Portal** (3 hours)
   - Customers need self-service billing (update card, cancel, view invoices)
   - Industry standard feature
   - Without it, you'll get support requests

2. **Billing Notification Emails** (3 hours)
   - Payment failed notifications
   - Payment successful confirmations
   - Subscription cancelled confirmations
   - Professional SaaS sends these

**Status**: Detailed tasks with AI prompts in `PRE_LAUNCH_CRITICAL_TASKS.md`

---

## 🚀 Your Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Complete Pre-Launch Tasks (6-8 hours)

Open `PRE_LAUNCH_CRITICAL_TASKS.md` and complete:
- [ ] Task 1.1-1.4: Stripe Customer Portal (3 hrs)
- [ ] Task 2.1-2.3: Billing notification emails (3 hrs)

**Why This Matters**:
- Self-service billing = fewer support requests
- Payment notifications = professional SaaS
- Both are industry standard

### Step 2: Archive Old Docs (10 minutes - OPTIONAL)

If you want to clean up (optional but recommended):

```powershell
# Create archive directories
mkdir -p docs/archived/session-summaries
mkdir -p docs/archived/old-plans
mkdir -p docs/archived/completed-tasks

# Move old files (copy-paste entire block)
mv AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv SESSION_SUMMARY*.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv TEST_*.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_OCT_6_2025.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv CLEANUP_PLAN*.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv CODEBASE_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv DEPLOYMENT_*.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv PLAYWRIGHT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md docs/archived/completed-tasks/
```

### Step 3: Launch! (7 days)

Open `MASTER_LAUNCH_PLAN.md` and start:
- Day 1: Lemon Squeezy setup
- Day 2: Automation
- Day 3: Support infrastructure
- Day 4: Marketing content
- Day 5: Testing & polish
- Day 6: Soft launch
- Day 7: Scale launch

**Target**: 10-15 sales in Week 1 = $2k-$5k revenue

## 📊 What Was Discovered in This Session

### Feature Gap Analysis

**Original Vision** (from old planning docs):
- ✅ RBAC system → **FULLY BUILT**
- ✅ Team management → **FULLY BUILT**
- ✅ Billing integration → **MOSTLY BUILT** (missing portal + emails)
- ❌ Admin support portal → **NOT BUILT** (not needed for launch)
- ❌ Support ticketing → **NOT BUILT** (buy later if needed)
- ❌ Safe impersonation → **NOT BUILT** (post-launch if needed)

**Decision**: Launch without admin portal/ticketing
- Use Clerk + Prisma Studio + Stripe dashboard for support
- Only 2-3 support requests expected Week 1
- Build admin features when you have 50+ customers and 15+ requests/week

**Savings**: ~60-80 hours of development time
