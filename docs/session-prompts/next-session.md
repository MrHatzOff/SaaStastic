# Next Session Prompt

**Context Recap**
- Completed major code reorganization and RBAC integration.
- Refactored `src/shared/ui/alert-dialog.tsx` to support controlled dialogs.
- Simplified `src/features/users/components/team-members-list.tsx` and resolved the auto-opening remove dialog issue.
- Ready to run end-to-end testing, then remove any remaining diagnostic code once tests pass.

**Key Follow-up Tasks**
1. Run targeted UI/UX tests on the Team Management page (invite, role change, remove member).
2. Confirm no regression in other alert dialogs across the app.
3. Remove any temporary logging or debug utilities post validation.
4. Document test results and update release notes.

**Helpful Commands**
```bash
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run test
```

**Discussion Starters for the Next Chat**
- What automated or manual tests should we prioritize to validate the dialog refactor?
- Any lingering edge cases around RBAC permissions that still need coverage?
- Plan for removing debug statements once verification passes.
- Outline acceptance criteria for shipping the Team Management improvements.
