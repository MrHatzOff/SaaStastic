# Manual Testing Guide for SaaStastic

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025  
**Purpose**: Simple step-by-step instructions for testing subscription features manually

## üéØ What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing means **you** (a real person) click through your website to make sure everything works correctly - just like your customers would use it. Think of it like test driving a car before buying it.

---

## üöÄ Before You Start

### What You Need:
1. **Your SaaStastic website running** - Either on your computer or on the internet
2. **A Stripe account** - Set to "Test Mode" (the toggle switch in Stripe dashboard)
3. **Test credit card numbers** from Stripe (these are fake cards that won't charge real money)

### Important: Always Use Test Mode!
- In your Stripe dashboard, make sure the toggle says **"Test Mode"** 
- Never use real credit card numbers during testing
- Test mode data is completely separate from real customer data

## üìã Complete Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Sign Up & Company Creation ‚úÖ
**What you're testing**: Can a new user create an account?

1. Open your website in a private/incognito browser window (this simulates a new user)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
3. Fill out the signup form
4. Create your company/organization name
5. **Expected result**: You should land on the dashboard

**What could go wrong**: If you get an error, the authentication might not be set up correctly.

---

### Test 2: View Pricing & Plans ‚úÖ
**What you're testing**: Can users see what they can buy?

1. While logged in, go to the Pricing page (usually `/pricing`)
2. Look at each plan (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
3. **Expected result**: You should see:
   - Plan names and prices
   - Features listed for each plan
   - "Subscribe" or "Get Started" buttons

**What could go wrong**: If prices don't show, check your plan configuration.

---

### Test 3: Subscribe to a Plan ‚úÖ
**What you're testing**: Can users actually buy a subscription?

1. Click "Subscribe" on any plan
2. You should be taken to a Stripe checkout page
3. Use a test card number: **4242 4242 4242 4242**
   - Expiry: Any future date (like 12/25)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (like 123)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (like 12345)
4. Click "Pay"
5. **Expected result**: You should return to your dashboard with a success message

**What could go wrong**: 
- If the page doesn't redirect to Stripe, your Stripe API keys might be wrong
- If payment fails, make sure you're using the test card number exactly as shown

---

### Test 4: Test Failed Payment ‚úÖ
**What you're testing**: Does the app handle payment failures correctly?

1. Try to subscribe again (or use a different plan)
2. This time use the "declined card" number: **4000 0000 0000 0002**
3. Click "Pay"
4. **Expected result**: You should see an error message saying the card was declined
5. You should NOT get a subscription

**What could go wrong**: If the error message is confusing or scary, you might need to improve the error handling.

---

### Test 5: View Billing Portal ‚úÖ
**What you're testing**: Can users manage their subscription?

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Find and click "Billing" or "Manage Subscription"
3. **Expected result**: You should be taken to Stripe's customer portal
4. You should see:
   - Your current plan
   - Your payment method
   - Billing history (invoices)
   - Option to cancel subscription

**What could go wrong**: If you get a "no subscription" error, Test 3 might not have worked.

---

### Test 6: Cancel Subscription ‚úÖ
**What you're testing**: Can users cancel when they want to?

1. From the billing portal, click "Cancel subscription"
2. Confirm the cancellation
3. **Expected result**: 
   - You should see confirmation that subscription is cancelled
   - The cancellation should show in your dashboard
   - You might see "active until [end date]" - this is normal!

**What could go wrong**: If cancellation doesn't work, check webhook settings (see Advanced Testing below).

---

## üîÑ What Are Webhooks? (Simple Explanation)

**Webhooks** are like text messages from Stripe to your website. When something happens in Stripe (like a payment succeeds or a subscription cancels), Stripe sends a message to your website saying "Hey! This just happened!"

Your website needs to:
1. Receive the message (webhook)
2. Update the database
3. Send a confirmation back to Stripe

**Why this matters for testing**: Sometimes there's a delay between when Stripe processes something and when your website updates. This is normal!

---

## üß™ Advanced Testing (Optional)

### Testing Subscription Changes

These tests require an **active subscription** first (complete Test 3 above):

#### Plan Upgrade
1. Go to pricing page
2. Subscribe to a more expensive plan
3. **Expected result**: Upgrade should happen immediately
4. Check billing portal to confirm new plan

#### Plan Downgrade  
1. Go to pricing page
2. Subscribe to a less expensive plan
3. **Expected result**: Downgrade usually happens at end of current billing period
4. Check billing portal - it should show "changes on [date]"

**Why these are optional**: These involve complex webhook processing and timing. They're important for production but can be tested when you're ready to launch.

---

## üêõ What If Something Breaks?

### Quick Troubleshooting:

**Problem**: Checkout page doesn't load
- **Fix**: Check that your Stripe API keys are correct in your `.env` file
- Make sure you're using TEST keys (start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)

**Problem**: Payment succeeds but dashboard doesn't update
- **Fix**: This is usually a webhook issue
- Check that webhooks are configured in Stripe dashboard
- Look for webhook errors in Stripe dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks

**Problem**: Error says "No company found"
- **Fix**: Log out and log back in
- Make sure you completed company creation
- Check that your user has a company in the database

**Problem**: "Permission denied" errors
- **Fix**: This is an RBAC (permission) issue
- Make sure your user role is OWNER or ADMIN
- Check that roles were created for your company

## üìä What Good Testing Looks Like

After completing all tests, you should have:
- ‚úÖ Successfully created an account
- ‚úÖ Subscribed to at least one plan
- ‚úÖ Tested a failed payment
- ‚úÖ Accessed the billing portal
- ‚úÖ Successfully cancelled a subscription
- ‚úÖ All features working smoothly

**Pro tip**: Test on both your computer AND your phone to make sure it works everywhere!

## üöÄ When to Use Staging vs Production

### Your Computer (localhost)
**When to use**: During development and initial testing
- **Pros**: Fast, easy to fix bugs immediately
- **Cons**: Only you can access it
- **Use test mode**: Always!

### Staging Environment (staging.yoursite.com)
**When to use**: Before launching to real customers
- **Pros**: Looks exactly like production, team can test
- **Cons**: Requires setup and deployment
- **Use test mode**: Yes! Always use test mode in staging

**Think of staging as**: A dress rehearsal before opening night

### Production (yoursite.com)
**When to use**: Only when everything works in staging
- **Pros**: Real customers can use it
- **Cons**: Bugs affect real people and real money!
- **Use test mode**: NO! Use LIVE mode here

**Think of production as**: Your real business running with real customers

## ‚úÖ Ready for Production?

Before switching to production (real customers), make sure:
- [ ] All 6 basic tests pass without errors
- [ ] You've tested on multiple devices (computer, phone, tablet)
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful (not scary)
- [ ] You have real Stripe API keys ready (LIVE keys, not test)
- [ ] Your team has tested everything in staging first
- [ ] You have a plan for monitoring after launch

---

## üìû Need Help?

If tests are failing and you can't figure out why:
1. Check the browser console for error messages (F12 key)
2. Check your server logs for errors
3. Check Stripe dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Logs
4. Look at the test results in `tests/e2e/` and `tests/unit/`

**Remember**: It's better to find bugs during testing than after real customers start using your app!
