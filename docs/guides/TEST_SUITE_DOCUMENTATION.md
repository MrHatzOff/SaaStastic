```

## 📊 Test Coverage Overview

### Unit Tests: 60/60 Passing ✅

#### 1. RBAC Permission System (18 tests)
**File**: `tests/unit/rbac-permissions.test.ts`

**What it tests**:
- All 29 system permissions are properly defined
- Permission naming conventions are followed
- Helper functions work correctly:
  - `checkPermission()` - Validates single permission
  - `hasAnyPermission()` - Validates if user has at least one permission
  - `hasAllPermissions()` - Validates if user has all required permissions
- Security edge cases (case sensitivity, partial matches, malformed input)
- Role-based permission sets (Owner: 29, Admin: 25, Member: 7, Viewer: 5)

**Why it matters**: This prevents unauthorized access to features and data.

---

#### 2. Tenant Isolation (12 tests)
**File**: `tests/unit/tenant-isolation.test.ts`

**What it tests**:
- Data is properly isolated between different companies (tenants)
- Users cannot access data from other companies
- Database queries are properly scoped by `companyId`
- Security edge cases (null handling, SQL injection attempts)
- Tenant context helpers work correctly

**Why it matters**: This is critical for multi-tenant security - prevents data leaks between customers.

---

#### 3. Stripe Webhook Handlers (15 tests)
**File**: `tests/unit/stripe-webhooks.test.ts`

**What it tests**:
- **Checkout Session Processing**:
  - Successful checkout creates subscription
  - Handles missing metadata gracefully
  - Updates company subscription status
  
- **Subscription Updates**:
  - Status changes are reflected in database
  - Metadata is properly stored
  - Handles subscription modifications
  
- **Subscription Cancellation**:
  - Properly marks subscription as canceled
  - Maintains data integrity
  - Logs cancellation events
  
- **Invoice Processing**:
  - Invoice creation is recorded
  - Payment success/failure handling
  - Invoice metadata is preserved
  
- **Payment Methods**:
  - Payment method updates are tracked
  - Old payment methods are cleaned up
  
- **Security & Reliability**:
  - Webhook signature verification
  - Idempotency (duplicate webhooks handled safely)
  - Error handling for malformed data
  - Database error recovery

**Why it matters**: Stripe sends important events to your app (payments, cancellations, etc.). These must be processed correctly or you'll have billing inconsistencies.

---

#### 4. User Invitations (15 tests)
**File**: `tests/unit/user-invitations.test.ts`

**What it tests**:
- **Invitation Creation**:
  - Valid invitations can be created
  - Email validation works
  - Role assignment is correct
  - Tenant isolation is enforced
  
- **Invitation Acceptance**:
  - Users can accept valid invitations
  - Invalid/expired invitations are rejected
  - User-company relationships are created
  
- **Invitation Revocation**:
  - Admins can revoke pending invitations
  - Revoked invitations cannot be accepted
  
- **Security**:
  - Users cannot invite to companies they don't belong to
  - Cross-tenant invitation attempts are blocked
  - Proper permission checks are enforced

**Why it matters**: Team collaboration requires secure invitation workflows. Bad implementation could allow unauthorized access.

### E2E Tests: 27/30 Passing ✅

#### Passing Tests (27)

**Authentication (3 tests)**:
- User signup flow
- User login flow
- Company creation after signup

**Billing (14 tests)**:
- View pricing page
- Complete checkout flow
- Handle declined payments
- Access billing portal
- View invoices
- Update payment method
- And more...

**Company Management (5 tests)**:
- Create company
- Update company details
- View company settings
- Manage company members
- Delete company

**Customer Management (5 tests)**:
- Create customer
- View customer list
- Update customer details
- Delete customer
- Customer search/filter

---

#### Skipped Tests (3)

These tests are **intentionally skipped** and require manual testing:

1. **Plan Upgrade** - Requires active subscription + async webhook processing
2. **Plan Downgrade** - Requires active subscription + async webhook processing
3. **Subscription Cancellation Flow** - Requires complex webhook simulation

**Why skipped?**: These tests require:
- Completing a full Stripe checkout first
- Waiting for Stripe webhooks to process (async)
- Multiple steps that are better tested manually in staging

**How to test these manually**: See `docs/testing/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

## 🧪 How to Run Tests

### Run All Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### Run Tests in Watch Mode (reruns when you change code)
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Run Tests with UI (visual interface)
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### Run Tests with Coverage Report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run E2E Tests in UI Mode (see browser)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## 🔍 Understanding Test Results

### ✅ Green/Passing Test
```
✓ tests/unit/rbac-permissions.test.ts (18)
  ✓ should validate Owner has all 29 permissions
```
**Meaning**: The test ran and everything worked as expected. Good!

### ❌ Red/Failing Test
```
✗ tests/unit/stripe-webhooks.test.ts (1)
  ✗ should handle subscription deletion
```
**Meaning**: Something is broken. The code didn't behave as expected. Fix required!

### ⊘ Skipped Test
```
⊘ tests/e2e/billing.spec.ts (1)
  ⊘ should allow plan upgrade
```
**Meaning**: This test was intentionally not run. Usually means it requires special setup.

## 🛠️ Test Infrastructure

### Configuration Files

**`vitest.config.ts`**:
- Configures Vitest test runner
- Sets up module aliases (@/ paths)
- Disables PostCSS for tests (speeds up test runs)
- Defines test environment

**`playwright.config.ts`**:
- Configures Playwright for E2E tests
- Sets up browser instances
- Defines test timeouts
- Configures test URLs

**`tests/unit/setup.ts`**:
- Loads test environment variables
- Sets up global test configuration
- Runs before all unit tests

### Mock Configuration

Tests use **mocks** (fake versions) of:
- **Database (Prisma)**: So tests don't touch real database
- **Stripe API**: So tests don't make real payment requests
- **Clerk Auth**: So tests don't need real user accounts

**Why mock?**: 
- Tests run faster (no network calls)
- Tests are reliable (no external dependencies)
- Tests are safe (won't charge real money or modify real data)

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

### Running Tests in CI/CD

Tests should run automatically when:
- You push code to GitHub
- You create a pull request
- You deploy to staging/production

**Example GitHub Actions workflow**:
```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run test:e2e
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Tests

### Test Fails Locally But Passes in CI
**Cause**: Environment differences (database state, environment variables)
**Fix**: 
- Check your `.env.test` file matches CI configuration
- Clear test database and re-run
- Make sure you're on the same Node version

### Tests Are Slow
**Cause**: Tests might be waiting for timeouts or making real network calls
**Fix**:
- Check that mocks are properly configured
- Reduce test timeouts if appropriate
- Run tests in parallel (Vitest does this by default)

### E2E Tests Timeout
**Cause**: Stripe redirects are slow, or page isn't loading
**Fix**:
- Increase timeout in test configuration
- Check that dev server is running
- Verify network connection
