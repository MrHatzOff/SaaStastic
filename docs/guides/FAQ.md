### **Q: Can I use this for multiple projects?**

**Depends on your license**:

| Tier | Projects | Transferable |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Starter** | 1 project | No |
| **Professional** | 1 project | No |
| **Agency** | Unlimited client projects | No |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited company projects | No |
| **Forever** | Unlimited projects forever | No |

**What counts as "1 project"?**
- One deployed SaaS application
- Can have dev/staging/production environments
- Multiple domains pointing to same app = still 1 project
- Same codebase for different clients = requires Agency or Enterprise

**Example scenarios**:
- ‚úÖ Starter: Build your own SaaS product
- ‚úÖ Professional: Build your company's SaaS product
- ‚úÖ Agency: Build SaaS products for 10 different clients
- ‚úÖ Enterprise: Build multiple products for your company
- ‚úÖ Forever: Build unlimited products, sell to unlimited clients

---

### **Q: Can I customize and resell SaaStastic itself?**

**No** - You cannot:
- ‚ùå Resell SaaStastic as a boilerplate
- ‚ùå Rebrand and sell as "YourName Starter"
- ‚ùå Compete with SaaStastic directly

**Yes** - You CAN:
- ‚úÖ Build SaaS products and sell them
- ‚úÖ Build client projects (Agency tier)
- ‚úÖ Modify the code completely
- ‚úÖ White-label your products (Enterprise/Forever)
- ‚úÖ Remove "Built with SaaStastic" footer (Pro+)

**Think of it like**: You can build and sell houses using blueprints you bought, but you can't sell copies of the blueprints themselves.

---

### **Q: What's your refund policy?**

**30-day money-back guarantee**:
- If you're not satisfied within 30 days, email us
- Full refund, no questions asked
- You must delete the code and stop using it

**After 30 days**: No refunds (you've had time to evaluate)

**Why so generous?** We're confident SaaStastic will save you months of work. If it doesn't, you shouldn't pay.

---

### **Q: Is this production-ready?**

**Yes!** SaaStastic is:
- ‚úÖ **Battle-tested** - Based on patterns from real production apps
- ‚úÖ **Secure** - Multi-tenant isolation, RBAC, audit logs, security headers

- Tests cover critical paths

**What you still need to do**:
- Add your specific business logic
- Configure your branding/design
- Set up production services (DB, Clerk, Stripe)
- Deploy to your hosting
- Add your domain

---

### **Q: What if I'm not familiar with the tech stack?**

**Learning curve depends on your background**:

**You'll be productive if you know**:
- React basics (components, hooks, state)
- TypeScript basics (types, interfaces)
- REST API concepts
- Basic SQL/database concepts

**You should learn first if you don't know**:
- JavaScript fundamentals
- React fundamentals
- How REST APIs work

**Resources to learn**:
- [Next.js Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) - Official guide (free)
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - Official docs (free)
- [Prisma Getting Started](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) - Database ORM (free)

**Time to learn**: ~1-2 weeks if completely new to React/Next.js

**Good news**: The codebase follows consistent patterns. Once you understand one feature, you understand them all.

---

### **Q: How do I add my own features?**

**Pattern to follow**:

1. **Create feature directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/features/your-feature/{components,hooks,types,utils}
   ```

2. **Add Prisma model**:
   ```prisma
   // prisma/schema.prisma
   model YourModel {
     id        String   @id @default(cuid())
     companyId String   // Required for multi-tenancy!
     name      String
     createdAt DateTime @default(now())
     
     company   Company  @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id])
     @@index([companyId])
   }
   ```

3. **Create API route**:
   ```typescript
   // src/app/api/your-feature/route.ts
   import { withPermissions, PERMISSIONS } from '@/shared/lib';
   
   export const GET = withPermissions(
     async (req, { companyId }) => {
       const data = await db.yourModel.findMany({
         where: { companyId } // Always scope by company!
       });
       return NextResponse.json(data);
     },
     [PERMISSIONS.YOUR_PERMISSION]
   );
   ```

4. **Build UI component**:
   ```typescript
   // src/features/your-feature/components/your-component.tsx
   import { PermissionGuard } from '@/shared/components';
   
   export function YourComponent() {
     return (
       <PermissionGuard permission="your:permission">
         <div>Your feature here</div>
       </PermissionGuard>
     );
   }
   ```

**See the guides**: [RBAC_USAGE.md](./RBAC_USAGE.md), [CUSTOMIZING_PERMISSIONS.md](./CUSTOMIZING_PERMISSIONS.md)

---

### **Q: Does this work with my existing database?**

**Maybe** - depends on your situation:

**‚úÖ Works if**:
- You're starting fresh (recommended)
- You can add `companyId` to all tables
- You're okay migrating data to new schema

**‚ùå Won't work if**:
- You need single-tenant architecture
- You can't modify existing schema
- You need to keep exact current structure

**Migration approach**:
1. Start with SaaStastic schema
2. Add your existing tables as Prisma models
3. Add `companyId` to all models
4. Write migration script to move data
5. Test multi-tenant isolation thoroughly

**Alternative**: Use SaaStastic for new app, migrate features over time

---

## üîí Security & Compliance

### **Q: Is multi-tenancy secure?**

**Yes!** Security is built-in at multiple layers:

**Database Level**:
- ‚úÖ All queries automatically scoped by `companyId`
- ‚úÖ Prisma middleware enforces tenant isolation
- ‚úÖ Row-level security (data physically separated)

**API Level**:
- ‚úÖ `withPermissions()` middleware checks auth + permissions
- ‚úÖ All requests validate user belongs to company
- ‚úÖ RBAC enforced on every endpoint

**UI Level**:
- ‚úÖ `<PermissionGuard>` hides unauthorized features
- ‚úÖ `usePermissions()` hook for conditional logic
- ‚úÖ Client-side guards as UX, server validates

**Tested**:
- ‚úÖ E2E tests verify tenant isolation
- ‚úÖ Unit tests cover permission logic
- ‚úÖ No data leakage between companies

**What you need to do**:
- Always include `companyId` in new models
- Always use `withPermissions()` for API routes
- Always scope queries by `companyId`
- Review the [RBAC_USAGE.md](./RBAC_USAGE.md) guide

---

### **Q: Is this GDPR/SOC2/HIPAA compliant?**

**Foundation is compliant-ready**:

**‚úÖ Already included**:
- Audit logging (who did what, when)
- Data isolation (tenant separation)
- Role-based access control
- Soft deletes (data retention)
- Secure authentication (Clerk)

**üîß You need to add**:

- Cookie consent (if EU users)
- Data export functionality (GDPR right to access)

## üéØ Comparison Questions

### **Q: SaaStastic vs. building from scratch?**

| Aspect | Building from Scratch | SaaStastic |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| **Time** | 4-6 months | 1-2 weeks |
| **Cost** | $135,000+ (dev time) | $399-$20,000 |

| **Security** | Learn as you go | Built-in best practices |
| **Testing** | Write from scratch | 87 tests included |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Complex, error-prone | Battle-tested patterns |
| **RBAC** | 3-4 weeks to build | 29 permissions ready |
| **Documentation** | You write it | Comprehensive guides |

**Bottom line**: Build from scratch if you have unique requirements. Use SaaStastic if you want standard B2B SaaS features fast.

---

### **Q: SaaStastic vs. other boilerplates?**

**What makes SaaStastic different**:
- ‚úÖ **Actually multi-tenant** - Most are single-tenant with "coming soon" promise
- ‚úÖ **Real RBAC** - 29 permissions, not just "admin vs user"
- ‚úÖ **Tested** - 87 passing tests; most have zero
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - No "TODO" comments in critical paths
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive docs** - Not just a README
- ‚úÖ **Modern stack** - Next.js 15, React 19, latest everything

**Comparison**:
- **ShipFast** ($299): Great for simple apps, no multi-tenancy or RBAC
- **Supastarter** ($399+): Good foundation, less comprehensive RBAC
- **Volca** ($4,500): Similar scope, older stack, less tested
- **SaaStastic**: Best for enterprise B2B with complex permissions

**Choose based on needs**:
- Simple SaaS ‚Üí ShipFast
- Medium complexity ‚Üí Supastarter
- **Enterprise B2B ‚Üí SaaStastic**
