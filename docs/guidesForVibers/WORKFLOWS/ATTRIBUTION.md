## Modifications Made for SaaStastic

The SaaStastic team has adapted the original ai-dev-tasks methodology with the following modifications:

### **Adaptations**:
1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Added sections for `companyId` scoping requirements
2. **RBAC Integration** - Included permission requirements in PRD templates
3. **Security Checklist** - Added security verification steps specific to multi-tenant SaaS
4. **SaaStastic File Structure** - Adapted file paths to match SaaStastic's safe zones
5. **Technology Stack** - Customized for Next.js 15, Prisma 6, Clerk, and Stripe
6. **Testing Requirements** - Added tenant isolation tests to execution protocol

### **Files Adapted**:
- `create-prd.md` - Enhanced with multi-tenant and RBAC sections
- `generate-tasks.md` - Modified to include security checkpoints
- `process-tasks.md` - Updated with SaaStastic-specific commit and testing protocols

### **Original Concepts Preserved**:
- Three-phase workflow (PRD ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Execution)
- Iterative refinement with clarifying questions
- Two-phase task generation (parent tasks, then sub-tasks)
- One-task-at-a-time execution with approval gates
- Test-then-commit protocol
