# üß© SaaStastic AI Coding Prompts - Puzzle Pieces on Steroids

**Purpose**: This file contains copy-paste prompt "puzzle pieces" that you can stack together to create powerful, context-rich AI coding sessions. Each piece provides specific context or requests specific actions.

---

## üéØ How to Use This File

### **The Puzzle Piece Concept**

Think of each prompt section as a LEGO brick. You **stack them together** to give your AI assistant:
1. ‚úÖ **Perfect Context** - What they need to know
2. ‚úÖ **Clear Task** - What you want them to do
3. ‚úÖ **Quality Constraints** - How to do it right

### **Basic Pattern**
```
[CONTEXT PIECE] + [TASK PIECE] + [QUALITY PIECE] = Great Result
```

### **Example Session**
```markdown
Copy this:
‚îú‚îÄ üß© General Onboarding (gives full context)
‚îú‚îÄ üß© Multi-Tenant Security Reminder (ensures safety)
‚îî‚îÄ üß© Your Specific Task (what you want built)

Paste all three together in one message to your AI.
```

## üì¶ SECTION 1: Context & Onboarding Pieces

### üß© **P1.1 - Full Onboarding Template**
**When to use**: Starting any new chat session
**Copy this:**

```
Hello and welcome to the SaaStastic team! üöÄ

Before we begin, please get acquainted with our codebase:

**MANDATORY READING** (Read these files in this order):
1. üìÑ `GUIDES/00_LLM_CONTEXT.md` - Complete project overview, architecture, and patterns
2. üìÑ `docs/guidesForVibers/LLM_ONBOARDING_CONTEXT.md` - AI-specific implementation rules
3. üìÑ `.windsurf/rules/architecture.md` - Non-negotiable security rules

**KEY PRINCIPLES**:
- ‚úÖ This is a multi-tenant B2B SaaS boilerplate
- ‚úÖ EVERY database query MUST include `companyId`
- ‚úÖ ALL API routes MUST use `withPermissions()` wrapper
- ‚úÖ Create new features in `src/features/custom/` (safe zone)
- ‚ùå NEVER modify `src/core/` files

**CURRENT STACK**:
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5
- Backend: Next.js API Routes with RBAC middleware
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM 6
- Auth: Clerk (multi-tenant aware)
- Payments: Stripe
- Styling: TailwindCSS 4 + shadcn/ui

Ready to help? Let me know what you'd like to build!
```

---

### üß© **P1.2 - Quick Context Reminder**
**When to use**: Mid-session when AI seems to forget the architecture
**Copy this:**

```
Quick reminder of our SaaStastic architecture:
- Multi-tenant: ALWAYS scope by `companyId`
- Security: ALL APIs need `withPermissions()` wrapper
- Validation: Use Zod schemas for all inputs
- Safe Zone: New features go in `src/features/custom/`
- Database: Prisma with audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy, deletedAt)
```

---

### üß© **P1.3 - Security Principles Reinforcement**
**When to use**: Before implementing database queries or API routes
**Copy this:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**:
   - EVERY query MUST have: `where: { companyId: context.companyId }`
   - Never trust client-provided IDs without validation
   
2. **Permission Checks**:
   - Wrap ALL API routes with `withPermissions([PERMISSIONS.X])`
   - Frontend: Use `<PermissionGuard>` for conditional rendering
   
3. **Input Validation**:
   - Define Zod schema for ALL user inputs
   - Parse with `.parse()` not `.safeParse()` (let errors bubble)

4. **Audit Trail**:
   - Include: createdBy, updatedBy, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Use soft deletes: deletedAt field instead of hard delete
```

---

## üì¶ SECTION 2: Task-Specific Prompt Pieces

## üì¶ SECTION 3: Feature-Specific Puzzle Pieces

### üß© **P3.1 - Add Custom Permission**
**When to use**: Need new permission beyond the 29 built-in ones
**Copy this:**

```
Add custom permissions for [FEATURE_NAME].

Steps:
1. Create: src/features/custom/[feature]/lib/permissions.ts
2. Define permissions:
   ```typescript
   export const CUSTOM_PERMISSIONS = {
     [FEATURE]_CREATE: 'custom:[feature]:create',
     [FEATURE]_READ: 'custom:[feature]:read',
     [FEATURE]_UPDATE: 'custom:[feature]:update',
     [FEATURE]_DELETE: 'custom:[feature]:delete',
   } as const;
   ```
3. Insert into database manually OR create seed script
4. Assign to roles via admin dashboard

DO NOT modify src/shared/lib/permissions.ts - keep custom permissions separate.
```

- Log sent emails in database for audit trail

Check GUIDES/11_OPTIONAL_INTEGRATIONS.md for Resend setup.
```

---

## üì¶ SECTION 4: Debugging & Problem-Solving Pieces

### üß© **P4.1 - Debug Authentication Issue**
**When to use**: Getting 401 errors or auth not working
**Copy this:**

```
Debug authentication issue: [describe the problem]

Checklist to verify:
1. Is Clerk properly configured? Check .env.local for CLERK_SECRET_KEY
2. Is the middleware running? Check src/middleware.ts
3. API route using: `await auth()` from '@clerk/nextjs/server'?
4. User exists in database? Check User table
5. UserCompany relation exists? Check UserCompany table
6. Company context being passed? Look at company-provider.tsx
7. Browser console errors? Check Network tab for 401 responses

Common fixes:
- Clear .clerk cache and restart dev server
- Verify Clerk webhook is receiving events
- Check that auth() is awaited (Clerk 6.x requirement)
```

---

### üß© **P4.2 - Debug Permission Denied**
**When to use**: Getting 403 Forbidden errors
**Copy this:**

```
Debug permission denied error for [action/route].

Steps to diagnose:
1. Check what permission is required: Look at API route withPermissions([X])
2. Check user's permissions: Query database or call /api/users/permissions
3. Verify user has correct role: Check UserCompany.roleId
4. Check role has permission: Query RoleModel permissions relation
5. Frontend: Use usePermissions() hook to see client-side permissions

Quick database check:
```sql
SELECT u.email, r.name as role, p.key as permission
FROM "User" u
JOIN "UserCompany" uc ON u.id = uc."userId"
JOIN "roles" r ON uc."roleId" = r.id
JOIN "_RolePermissions" rp ON r.id = rp."A"
JOIN "permissions" p ON rp."B" = p.id
WHERE u.id = '[user-id]' AND uc."companyId" = '[company-id]';
```

Solution: Either grant permission to role OR assign user a role with permission.
```

---

### üß© **P4.3 - Debug TypeScript Errors**
**When to use**: Build failing with type errors
**Copy this:**

```
Fix TypeScript errors in [file/component].

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Run: npx tsc --noEmit (shows all errors)
2. Check Prisma client: npx prisma generate (regenerate types)
3. Verify imports are correct (no missing exports)
4. Check tsconfig.json paths are correct
5. Restart TS server in IDE
6. Clear .next folder: rm -rf .next && npm run dev

Common issues:
- Prisma client out of sync: Run prisma generate
- Missing types: npm install @types/[package]
- Circular imports: Refactor import structure
```

---

## üì¶ SECTION 5: Full Feature Build Combinations

## üéØ Pro Tips for Maximum AI Productivity

### **1. Start Every Session with Context**
Always begin with P1.1 (Full Onboarding). Even experienced AIs benefit from context refresh.

### **2. Stack for Specificity**
```
Generic: "Build a CRM"  ‚ùå (Too vague)
Specific: [P1.1 + P1.3 + P5.1 + P6.1]  ‚úÖ (Clear requirements)
```

### **3. Reference Existing Code**
Add to any prompt: "Follow the pattern in src/app/api/users/team/route.ts"

### **4. Be Explicit About Safety**
When in doubt, add: "Create this in src/features/custom/ to keep it safe from core updates."

### **5. Request Incremental Delivery**
For large features: "Let's build this in phases. Start with the database model and API routes."

### **6. Ask for Explanations**
Add: "Explain your implementation decisions and any trade-offs."

## üì¶ SECTION 7: Feature Development Workflow (Ryan Carson Method)

**What is this?** A systematic approach to building complex features with AI. Based on the ai-dev-tasks system by Ryan Carson (Apache 2.0).

**Full Documentation**: `docs/guidesForVibers/WORKFLOWS/`

### **The Three-Phase Process**

**Phase 1: Create PRD** ‚Üí Define requirements collaboratively  
**Phase 2: Generate Tasks** ‚Üí Break down into steps  
**Phase 3: Execute** ‚Üí Implement with quality gates

---

### üß© **P7.1 - Quick Start: Feature PRD**

**When to use**: Planning complex features (CRM, inventory system, reporting)

**Copy this:**

```
I want to build [FEATURE_NAME] for SaaStastic.

Please help me create a Product Requirements Document using this process:

1. Read: docs/guidesForVibers/WORKFLOWS/create-prd.md
2. Read: GUIDES/00_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md (understand SaaStastic patterns)
3. Read: DEVELOPMENT_RULES/architecture.md (security requirements)

Ask me clarifying questions about:
- User stories and goals
- Multi-tenant requirements (how does companyId scoping work?)
- Permission requirements (what RBAC permissions are needed?)
- Data model needs (what tables/fields?)
- UI/UX expectations (what should users see?)
- Integration points (APIs, webhooks, etc.)

After I answer, generate a comprehensive PRD following the SaaStastic template.

Let's start with your clarifying questions.
```

---

### üß© **P7.2 - Generate Implementation Tasks**

**When to use**: You have a completed PRD and ready to implement

**Copy this:**

```
I have a completed PRD at tasks/prd-[feature-name].md

Please follow the task generation process from docs/guidesForVibers/WORKFLOWS/generate-tasks.md

Requirements:
1. Read the PRD thoroughly
2. Assess current SaaStastic codebase for existing patterns
3. Generate high-level parent tasks first
4. Wait for my approval
5. Then generate detailed sub-tasks for each parent task

SaaStastic-specific requirements:
- All features go in src/features/custom/
- All database models must include companyId
- All API routes must use withPermissions()
- Follow patterns in DEVELOPMENT_RULES/architecture.md

Ready? Start with the high-level tasks.
```

---

### üß© **P7.3 - Execute Task-by-Task**

**When to use**: Tasks generated, ready to implement

**Copy this:**

```
Let's implement the feature using tasks-prd-[feature-name].md

Follow the execution protocol from docs/guidesForVibers/WORKFLOWS/process-tasks.md

Rules:
1. Implement ONE sub-task at a time
2. After completing each sub-task:
   - Mark it [x] in the task list
   - Ask me for approval before proceeding
3. After completing ALL sub-tasks in a parent task:
   - Run: npm run test
   - If tests pass: git add . && git commit
   - Mark parent task [x]

Security checklist for EVERY sub-task:
- [ ] Multi-tenant: queries include companyId?
- [ ] RBAC: API routes use withPermissions()?
- [ ] Validation: inputs validated with Zod?
- [ ] TypeScript: no 'any' types?
- [ ] Tests: critical paths tested?

Ready to start with sub-task 1.1?
```

### üéØ When to Use Each Phase

| Phase | Use For | Don't Use For |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **PRD** | Complex features, unclear requirements | Simple UI changes, bug fixes |
| **Tasks** | Multi-step implementation | Single-file modifications |
| **Execute** | Building from scratch | Minor tweaks |

---

### üí° Pro Tips for Workflow Success

**1. Front-Load Clarity**
Spend time on PRD questions. 30 minutes of planning saves hours of refactoring.

**2. Reference Existing Features**
In your PRD: "Similar to the customer module, but for..."

**3. Break Down Large Tasks**
If a sub-task seems too big, ask: "Break sub-task 2.3 into smaller pieces"

**4. Don't Skip Tests**
The test-then-commit protocol catches bugs early and ensures quality.

**5. Save PRDs and Tasks**
These files are your documentation. Keep them in `/tasks/` directory.

---

### üìä Workflow vs. Puzzle Pieces

**Use Puzzle Pieces (Sections 1-6)** when:
- Quick feature additions
- You know exactly what you want
- Single-file changes
- Copy-paste and adapt approach

**Use Workflow System (Section 7)** when:
- Complex features with multiple moving parts
- Requirements need clarification
- Learning SaaStastic architecture
- Systematic, step-by-step approach needed

**Use Both**: Start with workflow for planning, use puzzle pieces during implementation!

---

### üéì Example: Building a CRM Module

**Phase 1: PRD (15 minutes)**
```
[Use P7.1]
- Clarifying questions about CRM needs
- Document: contacts, companies, deals, activities
- RBAC: Member and above can access
- UI: List view, detail view, forms
```

**Phase 2: Tasks (10 minutes)**
```
[Use P7.2]
Parent Tasks:
1.0 Database Schema (4 sub-tasks)
2.0 API Routes (8 sub-tasks)
3.0 React Components (6 sub-tasks)
4.0 Tests (3 sub-tasks)
```

**Phase 3: Execute (2-4 hours)**
```
[Use P7.3]
1.1 Create Contact model ‚úÖ
1.2 Create Company model ‚úÖ
[Test] ‚Üí [Commit] ‚Üí [Next parent task]
```

**Result**: Fully-functional CRM module with proper security, testing, and documentation.
