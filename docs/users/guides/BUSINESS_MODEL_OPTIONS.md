# 💼 SaaStastic Business Model Options

This document outlines different business models you can use when distributing SaaStastic, from open-source to SaaS-as-a-Service.

## 🎯 Distribution Models

### 1. Open Source Boilerplate (Current)

**How it works:**

- They deploy to their own infrastructure
- They own and control everything

**Pros:**

- ✅ Can be customized completely
- ✅ Users keep 100% of their revenue

**Cons:**

- ❌ Limited support scalability

**Revenue Models:**
- One-time purchase ($99-$999)
- Tiered pricing (Basic/Pro/Enterprise versions)
- Support subscriptions
- Custom development services

### 2. Managed SaaS Platform

**How it works:**
- You host the platform
- Users sign up and get their own tenant
- You handle all infrastructure and updates
- Users pay you monthly, you handle Stripe/billing

**Pros:**
- ✅ Recurring revenue model
- ✅ Users get started immediately
- ✅ You control updates and features
- ✅ Easier for non-technical users

**Cons:**
- ❌ High infrastructure costs
- ❌ Customer support burden

### 3. Hybrid Model (Recommended)

**How it works:**
- Offer both self-hosted and managed options
- Self-hosted: One-time purchase + optional support
- Managed: Monthly subscription for hosted version

**Example Pricing:**
```
Self-Hosted License:
- Basic: $299 (source code + basic docs)
- Pro: $999 (source code + advanced features + setup guide)
- Enterprise: $2999 (everything + 1-on-1 setup + 6 months support)

Managed Platform:
- Starter: $49/month (up to 100 users)
- Growth: $149/month (up to 1000 users)  
- Scale: $399/month (up to 10k users)
```

### 4. White-Label SaaS Service

**How it works:**
- You provide the platform as a service
- Customers get their own branded version
- You handle billing, infrastructure, updates
- Revenue sharing model

**Example:**
- Customer pays setup fee ($5k-$50k)
- You take 10-30% of their monthly revenue
- They get their own domain and branding
- You provide the technical infrastructure
