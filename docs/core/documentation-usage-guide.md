# SaaStastic Documentation Usage Guide (Proposed)

## üìö Core References
- **`product-vision-and-roadmap.md`**
  - *Purpose*: Single source for mission, product pillars, roadmap status, success metrics.
  - *When to Use*: Kickoff of any initiative, quarterly reviews, roadmap planning.
  - *Maintenance Cadence*: Update after each phase checkpoint or strategic shift.

- **`architecture-blueprint.md`**
  - *Purpose*: Current system architecture, directory contracts, guardrails, future evolution.
  - *When to Use*: Designing features, reviewing pull requests, onboarding engineers.
  - *Maintenance Cadence*: Refresh when architecture shifts (phase transitions, major refactors).

- **`coding-standards-and-workflows.md`**
  - *Purpose*: Canonical engineering standards, coding conventions, security requirements.
  - *When to Use*: Code reviews, writing new modules, setting up tooling, QA checklists.
  - *Maintenance Cadence*: Update whenever standards evolve or workflows change.

- **`technical-workflows.md`**
  - *Purpose*: Step-by-step flows for onboarding, feature/API development, DB schema changes, releases.
  - *When to Use*: New contributors, planning execution, running deployments.
  - *Maintenance Cadence*: After each process improvement or tooling change.

## üîÑ How to Adopt Updates
1. Draft changes in a temporary location (e.g. feature branch or dedicated proposal documents).
2. Once approved, place canonical references in `docs/core/`, adopter material in `docs/users/`, and shared guides in `docs/shared/`.
3. Archive superseded documents under `docs/archived/` (preserve timestamps or `_Vn` suffixes if helpful).
4. Announce updates in team channels and link from the relevant pull request.
5. Re-run onboarding checklist to ensure the new documentation is discoverable.

## üóÉÔ∏è Document Hygiene Checklist
- **Redundancy**: Remove/merge docs that duplicate new core references.
- **Accuracy**: Verify code snippets reflect current implementation.
- **Versioning**: Stamp documents with `Last Updated` date in header.
- **Discoverability**: Cross-link related docs (PRD ‚Üî architecture ‚Üî workflows).

## üß≠ Decision Log
- Maintain ADRs for architectural or process deviations.
- Link ADRs back to relevant sections in architecture and workflow docs.
