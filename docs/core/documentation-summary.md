# SaaStastic Documentation Refresh Summary

## 📌 Purpose
This directory contains proposed replacements for the current strategy, architecture, standards, and workflow documents. They consolidate duplicate information, remove outdated guidance, and align with the production-ready architecture rules documented in `.windsurf/rules/architecture.md`.

## 📂 Files Overview
- **`product-vision-and-roadmap.md`**
  - Aligns team on vision, pillars, roadmap status, and success metrics.
  - Update whenever phases change or strategic direction shifts.

- **`architecture-blueprint.md`**
  - Captures the current platform architecture, directory contracts, and guardrails.
  - Refresh after major architectural updates or phase transitions.

- **`coding-standards-and-workflows.md`**
  - Single source of truth for engineering standards, coding conventions, QA gates, and security requirements.
  - Maintain as coding practices evolve; review every sprint.

- **`technical-workflows.md`**
  - End-to-end workflows for onboarding, feature/API development, database changes, and releases.
  - Update immediately when processes or tooling change.

- **`documentation-usage-guide.md`**
  - Explains how to adopt, maintain, and cross-link the documentation system.
  - Treat as README for documentation; adjust whenever the documentation set changes.

## 🔁 Adoption Process
1. Review and approve each proposed document.
2. Publish canonical references under `docs/core/`, adopter guides under `docs/users/`, and shared material under `docs/shared/`.
3. Archive superseded documents in `docs/archived/` for historical reference.
4. Announce updates to the team and ensure onboarding workflows reference the new sources.

## 🧭 Maintenance Cadence
- Perform quarterly documentation health checks using this summary as a checklist.
- Ensure every new feature or architectural decision updates the relevant document(s) before merge.
