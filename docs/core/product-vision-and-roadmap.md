# SaaStastic Product Vision & Roadmap (Proposed V3)

## 🎯 Vision Statement
Deliver the most trusted, production-ready multi-tenant B2B SaaS starter that enables teams to launch enterprise-grade products in days—not months—without compromising on security, compliance, or developer experience.

## 🧭 Product Pillars
- **Security & Compliance First**
  - Built-in multi-tenant isolation, audit trails, GDPR/CCPA readiness.
- **Developer Velocity**
  - Opinionated patterns, batteries-included workflows, frictionless onboarding.
- **Enterprise Reliability**
  - Robust monitoring, rollback story, disaster recovery, and uptime guarantees.
- **Scalable Architecture**
  - Modular domains, clean separation of marketing/app/admin layers, predictable performance.

## 👥 Target Personas & Value Proposition
- **Founding Engineers** – accelerate initial product delivery with battle-tested patterns.
- **Platform Teams** – adopt as an internal starter kit ensuring organizational standards.
- **Agencies & Consultants** – reuse a hardened baseline for client implementations.

Value: Immediate access to compliant infrastructure, opinionated architecture, and guided workflows that keep teams aligned as the platform matures.

## 📈 Success Metrics (North Stars)
| Metric | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New developer onboarding time | < 30 minutes | Run through onboarding workflow and ship first change |
| Clean CI build rate | 100% | Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors, green Playwright suite |
| Tenant isolation regressions | 0 | Guarded by middleware, automated tests, and audit alerts |
| Time-to-launch for new SaaS vertical | < 1 week | Includes UI scaffolding, billing, auth, and analytics |

## 🗺️ Roadmap Overview

| Phase 1B – Polish & DX | ✅ Complete | TypeScript hygiene, documentation, workflows | Zero source errors, organized docs, streamlined onboarding |
| Phase 2A – RBAC Core | ✅ Complete | Permissions, roles, middleware | 29 permissions, role management, API protection |
| Phase 2B – Team UI | ✅ Complete | Team management interface | Enhanced role assignment, invitation UI, activity dashboard |
| Phase 3 – Support & Ops | ⚪ Not started | Admin portal, health & monitoring | Impersonation tooling, health dashboards, incident response |

## 🧩 Feature Pillars & Outcomes

## 🚦 Decision Framework
1. **Does it support the vision pillars?** If not, defer or archive.
2. **Does it threaten tenant isolation or compliance?** If yes, redesign before implementation.
3. **Can it be delivered within existing patterns?** Extend patterns first, create exceptions only with ADRs.
4. **Does documentation/workflow support it?** Ship docs + QA checklist alongside feature work.

## 🔁 Maintenance Cadence
- **Quarterly** – Validate roadmap alignment, migrate completed milestones, update success metrics.
- **Per Phase Transition** – Run architecture review, revise PRD acceptance criteria.
- **Post-Release** – Capture lessons learned, feed improvements into workflows and standards.
