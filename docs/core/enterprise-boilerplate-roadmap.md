# Enterprise Boilerplate Roadmap

A living plan for evolving SaaStastic into a fully featured enterprise SaaS boilerplate. Status icons use âœ… (complete), ðŸŸ¨ (in progress), and â¬œ (not started).

## Application Snapshot
- âœ… **Product Scope** â€” Multi-tenant B2B SaaS covering marketing, onboarding, billing, and team collaboration with Clerk + Stripe + PostgreSQL.
- âœ… **Architecture Pattern** â€” Next.js App Router with `src/core/`, `src/features/`, and `src/shared/` separation, enforcing company scoping and RBAC.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Operational Maturity** â€” Solid development workflows established; observability and production support playbooks are partially defined.

## Status Dashboard
- âœ… **Core Platform** â€” Authentication, marketing site, onboarding flow, and tenant-aware dashboard delivered.
- âœ… **Revenue & Billing** â€” Stripe checkout, subscription lifecycle, and webhook handling with RBAC coverage in place.
- âœ… **Tenant Security** â€” 29-permission RBAC system, with API middleware and frontend guards enforcing company isolation.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Team Collaboration** â€” Enhanced team management UI, invitations, and audit dashboards shipping incrementally.
- â¬œ **Support & Operations** â€” Admin support portal, real-time health monitoring, and self-service analytics pending.

## Feature Roadmap
### Completed Foundations
- âœ… **Authentication & Identity** â€” Clerk integration with user-company sync, protected routes, and tenant guards.
- âœ… **Billing & Monetization** â€” Subscription plans, webhook processing, and customer billing portal access.
- âœ… **RBAC Core** â€” Role/permission schema, provisioning logic, middleware, and permission-aware UI helpers.

### Remaining Feature Enhancements
- ðŸŸ¨ **Team Collaboration Enhancements** â€” Complete invite modal UX, bulk role reassignment, and activity dashboards in `src/features/users/`.
- â¬œ **Customer Support Portal** â€” Build secure impersonation tools, ticketing workflows, and audit viewers under `src/features/support/`.
- â¬œ **Customer Lifecycle Automation** â€” Add churn recovery emails, usage limits, and entitlement checks across modules.

## Infrastructure & Operations
- âœ… **Database Foundation** â€” Prisma schema with company scoping, soft deletes, audit fields, and role provisioning helpers.
- âœ… **Continuous Quality** â€” TypeScript strict mode, ESLint clean state, and structured documentation workflows.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Observability Stack** â€” Define logging, metrics, and tracing contracts inside `src/core/observability/`, including Sentry integration.
- â¬œ **Operational Runbooks** â€” Author incident response guides, deployment playbooks, and tenant onboarding automation scripts.
- â¬œ **Background Processing** â€” Introduce job queue/workers (e.g., BullMQ) for email, billing reconciliation, and audit exports.

## Security & Compliance
- âœ… **Tenant Isolation** â€” Verified company scoping for all database interactions plus automated role seeding during company creation.
- âœ… **Input Validation** â€” Zod schema coverage for API routes and server actions with consistent error handling responses.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Rate Limiting & CSRF Hardening** â€” Expand middleware to cover all state-changing endpoints and document configuration knobs.
- â¬œ **Compliance Tooling** â€” Add exportable audit logs, data retention policies, and configurable security headers (CSP, HSTS).
- â¬œ **Secrets Management** â€” Document rotation procedures and recommend vault integration for production deployments.

## Testing & Quality Gates
- âœ… **Static Analysis** â€” ESLint, TypeScript, and pre-commit validations run cleanly.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Automated Regression** â€” Expand Playwright suites to cover RBAC edge cases, billing flows, and invitation journeys.
- â¬œ **Integration & Load Testing** â€” Add Prisma-backed integration tests, contract tests for webhooks, and load tests simulating multi-tenant spikes.
- â¬œ **Release Validation** â€” Establish checklist: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, targeted smoke tests, and database migration dry-runs.

## Documentation & Workflows
- ðŸŸ¨ **Feature Guides** â€” Continue enriching `docs/users/guides/` (e.g., RBAC setup) with end-to-end walkthroughs for each module.
- â¬œ **Operations Handbook** â€” Produce support guides, SLA definitions, and escalation paths for future customer success teams.

### âœ… Recently Completed
- **RBAC Provisioner** (`src/core/rbac/`): âœ… **COMPLETE** - Implemented `provisionSystemRolesForCompany(companyId, tx)` helper that runs during company creation to automatically provision Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer roles with correct permission sets. Fully idempotent via unique constraints. Integration tested and working.

## Action Checklist
- ðŸŸ¨ **Finalize Team Management UI** â€” Complete UI polish, accessibility, and QA for bulk actions and invitations.
- â¬œ **Build Support Portal MVP** â€” Add impersonation guardrails, ticket intake, and activity replay tools.
- â¬œ **Harden Security Middleware** â€” Universal rate limiting, CSRF tokens, security headers, and CORS presets documented and enforced.
- â¬œ **Expand Automated Testing** â€” Achieve >80% coverage on critical paths, load test multi-tenant scenarios, and automate release gates.
- â¬œ **Author Operations Playbooks** â€” Document deployment, rollback, incident response, and tenant lifecycle procedures.

{{ ... }}
- â¬œ **Run Full Regression Suite** â€” Execute unit, integration, and E2E tests before milestone sign-off.
- â¬œ **Verify Database Migrations** â€” Use `prisma migrate dev` and shadow database checks for every schema change.
- â¬œ **Perform Security Review** â€” Review RBAC rules, audit logs, and middleware coverage prior to release.
- â¬œ **Update Documentation** â€” Sync `docs/core/` and workflow files after delivering each major feature or infrastructure capability.
