Let's build!

**This plan is designed to be:**
- ‚úÖ Actionable (every task has clear deliverables)
- ‚úÖ Realistic (time estimates based on experience)
- ‚úÖ Scalable (systems that work at 10 or 1,000 customers)
- ‚úÖ Low-maintenance (automation + self-service)
- ‚úÖ High-leverage (create once, benefit forever)

**Your goal**: Create such good documentation and systems that customers rarely need to ask questions, and when they do, the community answers before you even see it.
