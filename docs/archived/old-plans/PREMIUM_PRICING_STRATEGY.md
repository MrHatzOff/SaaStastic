# üíé Premium Pricing Strategy Analysis

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Question**: Can we sell at $5k-$15k to fewer customers and avoid support burden?

---

## üéØ The Core Question

**You're Right**: SaaStastic is worth $5k-$15k in actual value (135k+ in dev costs saved).

**Market Reality**: The boilerplate market has a **psychological price ceiling** around $1,000-$1,500.

**The Gap**: How do we capture that $5k-$15k value without fighting market psychology?

---

## üí∞ Current Boilerplate Market Ceiling

### **Actual Premium Market Pricing**

| Product | Entry Price | Premium Price | Max Price | Model |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| **ShipFast** | $199 | $299 | $299 | One-time |
| **SaaS Pegasus** | $249 | $449 | **$999** | One-time, unlimited projects |
| **Supastarter** | $279 | $399 | $399 | One-time |
| **Volca** | - | $999 | $999 | One-time |
| **Divjoy** | $129 | $299 | $299 | One-time |
| **MakerKit** | $299 | $799 | $799 | One-time |
| **Gravity** | $497 | - | $497 | One-time |

**Highest Price Found**: $999 (SaaS Pegasus Unlimited, Volca)

**No One Goes Above $1,000** for code-only boilerplates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why $5k-$15k Doesn't Work for Code Boilerplates

### **Psychological Barriers**

1. **Price Anchoring**
   - Developers expect code libraries to be $50-$500
   - $1,000 is already pushing mental limits
   - $5,000 triggers "this should include services" expectation

2. **Tangibility Problem**
   - At $5k, buyers expect:
     - Implementation help
     - Custom features
     - Dedicated support
     - Training/onboarding calls
   - Code-only feels "incomplete" at that price

3. **Competitive Pressure**
   - If ShipFast is $299, why pay $5k?
   - Need 20x more value to justify
   - Hard to demonstrate that delta

4. **Trust Threshold**
   - $5k requires high trust
   - Boilerplates are still relatively new category
   - Risk feels higher at that price

### **Market Segments**

| Price Range | Buyer | What They Expect |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| **$99-$299** | Solo devs, side projects | Code + docs |
| **$500-$999** | Serious builders, funded startups | Code + docs + community |
| **$1,500-$5,000** | Agencies, companies | **Code + implementation services** |
| **$5,000-$15,000** | Enterprise | **Full solution + customization + support** |

**Key Insight**: Above $1,000, buyers expect **services**, not just code.

## üí° How to Capture Premium Value (The Hormozi Way)

### **Strategy: Tier the VALUE, Not Just the Code**

**Base Product**: $997 (like planned)
- Full codebase
- All documentation
- Single project license
- 30 days email support

**But ADD Premium Tiers with SERVICES**:

#### **Tier 1: Professional ($997)** ‚úÖ Launch Here
- Everything above
- Solo developers, startups
- **VALUE**: $135k in dev time saved

#### **Tier 2: Agency ($4,997)** üöÄ Add Month 2
- Everything in Professional
- **+ Unlimited client projects** (key differentiator)
- **+ 2 hours of implementation consulting**
- **+ Priority support (48-hour response)**
- **+ Agency showcase on website**
- For: Agencies building client SaaS products
- **VALUE**: $135k √ó 5 clients = $675k value

#### **Tier 3: Enterprise ($9,997)** üíé Add Month 3
- Everything in Agency
- **+ Unlimited projects**
- **+ 10 hours of implementation consulting** (video calls)
- **+ White-label rights** (remove "Built with SaaStastic")
- **+ Custom feature development** (1 medium feature)
- **+ Dedicated Slack channel**
- **+ Priority feature requests**
- For: Companies, well-funded startups
- **VALUE**: Priceless (custom dev would be $50k+)

## üéØ The Alex Hormozi Value Equation

**Hormozi's Formula**:
```
Value = (Dream Outcome √ó Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay √ó Effort/Sacrifice)
```

### **Applied to SaaStastic**

#### **Dream Outcome**: Launch profitable B2B SaaS
- Professional tier: "I can build and launch"
- Agency tier: "I can build for 5+ clients"
- Enterprise tier: "Custom solution, no tech risk"

#### **Perceived Likelihood**: Increase with proof
- 87 automated tests (de-risks)
- 3,500+ lines of docs (reduces effort)
- Customer showcases (social proof)
- Your expertise (credibility)

#### **Time Delay**: Minimize
- Professional: Launch in 3 days
- Agency: Launch 5 client projects in a month
- Enterprise: Custom feature in 2 weeks (vs 3 months DIY)

#### **Effort/Sacrifice**: Reduce
- Professional: Just customize
- Agency: We handle the boilerplate, you focus on client work
- Enterprise: We implement, you get results

**Result**: Each tier has 10-20x ROI at those prices

**YES!** These are actually **valuable additions** to the boilerplate:

### **Feature 1: License Management System**

## üéØ Can We Use SaaStastic to Sell SaaStastic NOW?

### **Current State Assessment**

**What We Have** ‚úÖ:
- Professional marketing pages (hero, features, pricing)
- Stripe checkout integration
- Beautiful UI components
- Contact forms, about page

**What We're Missing** ‚ùå:
1. **Copy/Messaging** - Currently says "multi-tenant SaaS solution", should say "B2B SaaS boilerplate"
2. **One-time Purchase Flow** - Currently set up for subscriptions
3. **License Delivery System** - Need to send GitHub access after purchase
4. **Product Pages** - Need pages about the actual boilerplate features
5. **Download/Access Portal** - Where customers get their code

### **Gap Analysis: What to Build**

| Component | Current State | Needed for Selling Boilerplate | Build Time |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| **Landing Page** | ‚úÖ Generic SaaS | Need boilerplate copy | 2-3 hours |
| **Pricing Page** | ‚úÖ But wrong pricing | Update to $997/$4,997/$9,997 | 1 hour |
| **Checkout** | ‚úÖ Subscription | Change to one-time | 2-3 hours |
| **License System** | ‚ùå None | Build from scratch | 8-12 hours |
| **GitHub Access** | ‚ùå None | Automate invite on purchase | 3-4 hours |
| **Email Automation** | ‚ùå None | Welcome series | 2-3 hours |
| **Customer Portal** | ‚ùå None | Download code, docs, support | 6-8 hours |

**TOTAL BUILD TIME**: **24-34 hours** (3-4 days of focused work)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Real Talk: Support Demands

### **What to Expect at Each Tier**

**Professional ($997) Customers**:
- Questions: 5-10 per customer (setup, customization)
- Support time: 2-3 hours average
- **Volume**: 15/month √ó 3 hours = 45 hours

**Agency ($4,997) Customers**:
- Questions: More technical, fewer silly questions
- Support time: 4-6 hours average (but SCHEDULED consulting)
- **Volume**: 3/month √ó 6 hours = 18 hours

**Enterprise ($9,997) Customers**:
- Questions: Strategic, not tactical
- Support time: 10-12 hours average (scheduled calls + custom dev)
- **Volume**: 1/month √ó 12 hours = 12 hours

**TOTAL**: ~75 hours/month (~18 hours/week)

### **But Wait... That's More Than Current Plan!**

**Key Differences**:

1. **Scheduled vs Reactive**
   - Current plan: Random support questions (draining)
   - Premium plan: Scheduled consulting calls (energizing)

2. **Quality of Questions**
   - $997 buyers: "How do I install Node.js?"
   - $9,997 buyers: "Can we integrate with our SSO?"

3. **Revenue Per Hour**
   - Professional: $997 √∑ 3 hours = $332/hour
   - Agency: $4,997 √∑ 6 hours = $833/hour
   - Enterprise: $9,997 √∑ 12 hours = $833/hour

**Bottom Line**: You're getting paid $300-$800/hour for support. That changes everything.
