# 💰 Pricing Model Analysis: One-Time vs Subscription Hybrid

**Date**: October 8, 2025

## 🎯 The Two Models Compared

### **Model A: All One-Time (Original Recommendation)**

| Tier | Price | What You Get | Restrictions |
|------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Professional** | $997 one-time | 1 project, 1 year updates | "Built with SaaStastic" footer |

## 🔬 Deep Dive Analysis

### **Professional Tier: Your Proposal is EXCELLENT** ✅

**Your Model**:
- $997 one-time
- Use forever on 1 project
- 12 months of updates included
- "Built with SaaStastic" footer
- **Then**: Optional $250-500/year for continued updates/support

**Why This Works**:

1. **Low Barrier to Entry**
   - One-time payment = easier decision
   - "I own it forever" psychological comfort
   - Competitive with ShipFast ($299), Pegasus ($449)

2. **Recurring Revenue Opportunity**
   - 12 months later, they're making money with your code
   - $250-500/year feels cheap vs rebuilding
   - 30-50% will renew (industry average for maintenance)

3. **Attribution Leverage**
   - "Built with SaaStastic" footer creates social proof
   - They can pay to remove it (upsell to Agency)
   - Or keep it and save money (win-win)

4. **Clear Value Ladder**
   - Year 1: $997 (front-end profit)
   - Year 2+: $250-500/year (backend profit)
   - LTV: $997 + (3 years × $350) = $2,047

**Recommendation**: ✅ **DO THIS**

### **Agency Tier: Subscription Has Trade-offs** ⚠️

**Your Model**: $4,997/year for 5 new projects per year

#### ✅ **PROS of Subscription**:

1. **Recurring Revenue**
   - Predictable MRR
   - $4,997 × 10 agencies = $49,970/month recurring

2. **Usage-Based Fairness**
   - Agencies building 1 project/year vs 10/year pay same
   - 5 projects cap feels fair

3. **Ongoing Relationship**
   - Annual touchpoint to upsell Enterprise
   - Can add value throughout year
   - Support is "included" not "extra"

4. **Churn is Revenue**
   - If they stop building client projects, they churn = fair
   - Not paying for unused value

#### ❌ **CONS of Subscription**:

1. **Higher Sales Friction**
   - "Another subscription?!" - subscription fatigue is real
   - Agencies have to justify annually to accounting
   - Competitor (Pegasus Unlimited: $999 one-time) looks better

2. **Project Tracking Burden**
   - How do you enforce "5 projects per year"?
   - What counts as a "new" project vs maintenance?
   - Need system to track and limit

3. **Churn Risk**
   - Agency builds 5 client sites in Year 1
   - Year 2: Only has 2 new clients
   - Cancels subscription (but still uses old projects)

4. **Enforcement Challenges**
   - They have the code from Year 1
   - Can they use it after subscription ends?
   - If yes, why renew?
   - If no, how do you enforce?

#### 🤔 **Alternative Agency Model**:

**Option 1: Project Packs (One-Time)**
- Base: $997 (1 project)
- 5-Pack: $3,997 ($799/project) - save $1,000
- 10-Pack: $6,997 ($699/project) - save $3,000
- Unlimited: $9,997

**Why This Works**:
- No subscription friction
- Clear value (bulk discount)
- Easy to understand
- No tracking needed (honor system)

**Option 2: Annual with Perpetual Fallback**
- $4,997/year while subscribed: Unlimited projects + support + updates
- **After cancellation**: Keep using all projects built while subscribed
- Re-subscribe anytime to start new projects

**Why This Works**:
- Best of both worlds
- Churn isn't "losing access"
- Incentive to stay subscribed (new projects)
- Fair value exchange

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **Consider Project Packs or Perpetual Fallback instead of strict subscription**

### **Enterprise Tier: Subscription Makes More Sense** ✅

**Your Model**: $9,997/year for unlimited projects + white-label

#### ✅ **Why Subscription Works Here**:

1. **Service Component**
   - 10 hours consulting/year = ongoing service
   - Dedicated support = ongoing cost to you
   - Custom features = ongoing value delivery

2. **White-Label is Ongoing**
   - Not just "remove footer once"
   - New releases without attribution
   - Ongoing benefit justifies ongoing payment

3. **Enterprise Expects Subscriptions**
   - Companies budget for annual software
   - $10k/year is normal for enterprise tools
   - SLA and support requires subscription

4. **Higher Value = Easier Renewal**
   - If they're using it, $10k/year is cheap
   - If they're not, they should churn
   - Natural selection of active customers

#### 🎯 **Enhanced Enterprise Model**:

**$9,997/year includes**:
- Unlimited projects while subscribed
- White-label rights
- 10 hours consulting/year (reset annually)
- Priority support (24-hour response)
- Custom feature requests (1 medium/year)
- Dedicated Slack channel

**After cancellation**:
- Keep all projects built while subscribed
- Lose white-label rights (footer returns)
- Lose priority support
- Lose consulting hours

**Recommendation**: ✅ **DO THIS with perpetual fallback for projects**

---

### **Forever License: $20k is GENIUS** 🚀

**Your Model**: $20k one-time, unlimited everything forever, can't resell as boilerplate

#### ✅ **Why This is Brilliant**:

1. **Captures Maximum Value**
   - Agency building 50 client projects over 5 years
   - $20k ÷ 50 = $400/project (cheap!)
   - vs annual: $50k over 5 years ($10k × 5)

2. **Cash Flow for You**
   - $20k upfront vs $10k/year = 2 years revenue NOW
   - Reinvest in marketing, features
   - Less churn risk

3. **Perfect for Studios/Agencies**
   - They know they'll use it heavily
   - Budgeting for capital expense easier than opex
   - "We own it" psychological win

4. **Clear Restrictions**
   - Can't resell as SaaStastic ✅
   - Can't compete as boilerplate ✅
   - Everything else is fair game ✅

5. **Anchoring Effect**
   - Makes $9,997/year look cheap ("$10k vs $20k")
   - Makes unlimited pack look cheap
   - Premium positioning

#### 🎯 **What Forever Includes**:

**$20,000 one-time**:
- ✅ Unlimited projects forever
- ✅ White-label rights forever
- ✅ Lifetime updates (forever, not just 1 year)
- ✅ Priority support forever
- ✅ Commercial use (except competing boilerplate)
- ✅ Can build client projects
- ✅ Can build own SaaS products
- ❌ Cannot resell as SaaStastic
- ❌ Cannot create competing boilerplate

**Recommendation**: ✅ **ABSOLUTELY DO THIS**

## 🎯 Retention & LTV Analysis

### **Professional Tier ($997 + renewals)**

**Year 1**: $997 (100% have it)  
**Year 2**: $350 renewal (35% take it) = $122.50  
**Year 3**: $350 renewal (35% of Y2 = 12% total) = $42.88  
**3-Year LTV**: $1,162

**Why 35% renewal rate?**
- Industry average for maintenance: 30-50%
- They're making money with your code
- $350/year is cheap insurance
- Dependency updates are real pain

### **Agency Tier ($4,997 + renewals)**

**Year 1**: $4,997 (one-time)  
**Year 2**: $997 renewal (50% take it) = $498.50  
**Year 3**: $997 renewal (50% of Y2 = 25% total) = $249.25  
**3-Year LTV**: $5,745

**Why 50% renewal rate?**
- They're actively using it for clients
- $997/year is cheap for business license
- Agencies value support + updates

### **Enterprise Tier ($9,997/year subscription)**

**Year 1**: $9,997  
**Year 2**: $9,997 (80% renewal) = $7,998  
**Year 3**: $9,997 (80% of Y2 = 64% total) = $6,398  
**3-Year LTV**: $24,393

**Why 80% renewal rate?**
- High touch relationship (10 hours consulting)
- Dedicated support creates stickiness
- White-label rights are valuable
- Enterprise SaaS averages 90% retention

### **Forever Tier ($20,000 one-time)**

**Year 1**: $20,000  
**Year 2-∞**: $0  
**3-Year LTV**: $20,000

**But**:
- No churn risk
- Cash upfront
- Can reinvest immediately

## 💡 The Enforcement Question

### **How Do You Track "5 Projects Per Year" for Agency Subscription?**

**Option 1: Honor System** (Recommended)
- Trust them to self-report
- Most businesses are honest
- Cost of enforcement > value recovered
- Focus on delivering value, not policing

**Option 2: License Keys per Project**
- Generate unique key per project
- They register each new project
- After 5, need to upgrade or renew
- **Problem**: Easy to bypass (it's code they have)

**Option 3: Phone Home** (Don't Do This)
- Code calls your server to validate
- Developers HATE this
- Will patch it out
- Damages reputation

**Recommendation**: 
- If you go subscription route, use **perpetual fallback**
- "While subscribed: unlimited. After cancel: keep what you built, can't start new ones"
- This is enforceable through support ("Can you help with new project?" "Are you subscribed?")

---
