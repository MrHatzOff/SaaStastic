## 📋 Context for LLM

I'm working on preparing the SaaStastic B2B SaaS boilerplate for sale. 

**Current Status**:
- ✅ All core features complete (auth, billing, RBAC, team management)
- ✅ 87 tests passing (60 unit + 27 E2E)
- ✅ TypeScript 100% compliant (source code)
- ✅ ESLint warnings reduced 51%
- ✅ Production-ready codebase

**What We Need**:
Customer-facing documentation and marketing materials to sell the boilerplate with minimal ongoing support (<15 hours/week).

**Full Plan**: See `docs/core/BOILERPLATE_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`

## 📝 Session Prompts

### **To Start Task 1.1 (Setup Guide)**:
```
I'm ready to create the customer setup guide for SaaStastic boilerplate.

Please help me create docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md with:
1. Prerequisites section (Node.js, PostgreSQL, accounts needed)
2. Clerk setup walkthrough (step-by-step)
3. Stripe setup walkthrough (including webhooks)
4. Database configuration (local and production)
5. Environment variables reference with descriptions
6. Deployment instructions (Vercel, Docker)
7. Troubleshooting section for common issues

Target: Zero-friction setup that eliminates 80% of support questions.

Review the current .env.example and codebase to ensure accuracy.
```

---

### **To Start Task 1.2 (README Enhancement)**:
```
I need to transform our basic README.md into a compelling landing page.

Please help me create:
1. Attention-grabbing value proposition
2. Feature showcase (highlighting 29 permissions, 87 tests, complete billing)
3. "What This Saves You" section (time + money)
4. Quick start guide (3 steps to get running)
5. Tech stack badges and overview
6. Support & community information

Make it conversion-focused - goal is 30%+ conversion rate from readers to buyers.

Reference the current codebase features and docs/core/product-vision-and-roadmap.md for accuracy.
```

---

### **To Start Task 1.3 (Feature Guides)**:
```
I need to create detailed feature guides for customers.

Start with: docs/guides/RBAC_USAGE.md

Please help me create a comprehensive guide covering:
1. Overview of the 29-permission system
2. How to check permissions in React components (usePermissions hook)
3. How to protect API routes (withPermissions middleware)
4. Frontend permission guards (<PermissionGuard>)
5. Real-world examples (10+ code snippets from actual codebase)
6. Common patterns and best practices

Review these files for accuracy:
- src/shared/lib/permissions.ts
- src/shared/hooks/use-permissions.ts
- src/shared/lib/rbac-middleware.ts
- src/shared/components/permission-guard.tsx
```

---

### **To Start Task 1.4 (JSDoc)**:
```
I need to add professional JSDoc comments to our public APIs.

Start with: src/shared/lib/permissions.ts

For each exported function/constant, add JSDoc with:
- Description (what it does)
- @param (for each parameter with type and description)
- @returns (what it returns)
- @example (real code example showing usage)
- @see (link to related documentation)

Format example:
/**
 * Checks if user has specified permission in current company context.
 * 
 * @param permission - Permission slug to check
 * @returns true if user has permission, false otherwise
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const canInvite = hasPermission(PERMISSIONS.USERS_INVITE);
 * ```
 * 
 * @see {@link docs/guides/RBAC_USAGE.md}
 */

Review the file and add appropriate JSDoc to all public exports.
```
