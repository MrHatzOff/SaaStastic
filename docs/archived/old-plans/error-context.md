# Authentication & RBAC Error Context - RESOLVED

**Last Error**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Previous Critical Error (RESOLVED)

### Issue: "User ID not found. Please sign in again."
**Root Cause**: Clerk 6.x `auth()` function was not being awaited in API middleware  
**Impact**: All API routes returned 401 Unauthorized  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Solution Applied
1. **Fixed `api-middleware.ts`**:
   - Added `await auth()` call (was missing await)
   - Removed `currentUser()` call causing 23-second timeouts
   - Added auto-sync for users from Clerk to database

2. **Fixed `rbac-middleware.ts`**:
   - Auto-fetches company context if not provided in headers
   - Eliminates "Company context required" errors
   - Makes company resolution consistent

3. **Fixed `companies/route.ts`**:
   - Auto-creates user in database if doesn't exist
   - Syncs user data from Clerk on first API call

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- User authentication with Clerk 6.x
- Company creation (8-second RBAC provisioning)
- User invitations
- All 29 RBAC permissions
- Multi-tenant isolation

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- **Playwright E2E Tests**: Timing out due to company creation delay
  - Manual workflows: ✅ Working
  - Automated tests: Need timeout increase
  - Location: `tests/e2e/auth-setup.ts` line 44
  - Fix: Increase timeout from 30s to 60s

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow (Current)
1. User signs in with Clerk
2. Clerk session established
3. API middleware calls `await auth()`
4. Gets `userId` from Clerk
5. Checks if user exists in DB
6. If not, auto-creates from Clerk data
7. Fetches user's company context
8. Returns authenticated context

### Performance Metrics
- Auth check: ~100ms
- Company creation: ~8 seconds (includes RBAC setup)
- User auto-sync: ~200ms
- Total onboarding: ~10 seconds
