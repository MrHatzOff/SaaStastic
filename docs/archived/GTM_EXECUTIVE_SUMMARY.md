- ✅ `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Zero-friction 30-minute setup
- ✅ `README.md` - Conversion-optimized sales copy

- Clear differentiation: 29 permissions, 87 tests, true B2B focus

---

## 🎯 Strategic Decisions Made

### **1. Sales Platform: Lemon Squeezy** ⭐

**Why Not Gumroad**:
- Saves $70 per sale (5% vs 10% fees)
- Professional checkout (3x better conversion)
- Built for SaaS products
- At 100 sales: Save $7,000 vs Gumroad

**Why Not Custom Site (Yet)**:
- Would delay launch 2-3 weeks
- Need validation first
- Can migrate later at $50k+ revenue

**The Plan**:
1. **Month 1-2**: Launch on Lemon Squeezy ($997)
2. **Month 3+**: Migrate to SaaStastic itself (ultimate dog-fooding)

---

### **2. Pricing: $997 One-Time**

**Single Product Strategy**:
- Everything included: full codebase, 29 permissions, all docs
- Lifetime updates (1 year major + forever patches)
- No tiers (avoids codebase maintenance nightmare)

**Why $997 Works**:
- Premium positioning vs ShipFast ($199)
- Attracts serious customers (less support burden)
- Value is clear: $135k worth of development
- Below Volca ($999) for psychological anchor

**Price Progression**:
- Launch: $997 (first 100 customers)
- Month 3: $1,197 (20% increase)
- Month 6: $1,497 (mature pricing)

---

### **3. Licensing: Single-Project with Honor System**

**The License**:
- ✅ One SaaS product per license
- ✅ Unlimited dev/staging environments
- ❌ No multi-project use
- ❌ No resale/redistribution

**Enforcement Strategy**:
- Honor system (like ShipFast's 7,600 sales)
- Support tied to compliance
- Update access requires validation
- Community recognition for compliance

**Future Upsells**:
- Multi-Project: $2,997 (5 products)
- Agency License: $4,997 (unlimited client work)
- Enterprise: $9,997 (white-label)

---

### **4. Legal: Templates Now, Lawyer Later**

**Launch With** ($0-$97):
- Software License Agreement (TermsFeed or Ross Patel's template)
- Terms of Service (free generator)
- Privacy Policy (free generator)
- Refund Policy (write it yourself)

**Lawyer After $50k** ($2,000-$5,000):
- Custom-drafted agreements
- Entity formation (LLC)
- Enterprise contract templates

---

### **5. Demo Strategy: Environment First, App Later**

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**: Deploy Demo Environment
- Seed realistic data (customers, team, invoices)
- 3 test accounts (Owner, Admin, Member)
- Disable destructive operations
- Banner: "Demo Mode"
- **Time**: 4-8 hours vs 3-5 weeks for full app

**Phase 2 (Month 3+)**: Consider Building Demo App
- Only after validation ($30k+ revenue)
- Shows full build story
- Additional revenue stream
- But NOT required for launch

**Phase 3 (Month 3+)**: Use SaaStastic to Sell SaaStastic
- Ultimate showcase: "Built with SaaStastic"
- Best possible marketing
- Proves production-readiness

## ⚠️ Critical Risks & Mitigations

### **Risk 1: Price Too High**
- **Mitigation**: 30-day money-back guarantee
- **Validation**: ShipFast grew from $199 to $299, Volca at $999
- **Backup**: Can offer limited "Starter" at $497 if needed

### **Risk 2: License Violations**
- **Reality**: 5-10% will violate, but that's acceptable
- **Mitigation**: Honor system + support tied to compliance
- **Decision**: Cost of enforcement > value recovered

### **Risk 3: Too Much Support Load**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation (3,500+ lines)
- **Strategy**: Premium price = premium customers = less support
- **Goal**: <10 hours/week by Month 2

### **Risk 4: Competition**
- **Reality**: ShipFast at $199-$299 is strong competitor
- **Differentiation**: Enterprise features, better docs, B2B focus
- **Strategy**: Serve different segment (serious builders, not hobbyists)
