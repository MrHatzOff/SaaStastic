## 🚀 YOUR IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Step 1: Clean Up Docs** (10 minutes)

Run these commands to archive old docs:

```bash
# Create archive directories
mkdir -p docs/archived/session-summaries
mkdir -p docs/archived/old-plans
mkdir -p docs/archived/completed-tasks

# Archive root files (copy-paste entire block)
mv AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv SESSION_SUMMARY*.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv TEST_*.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_OCT_6_2025.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv START_HERE_NEXT_SESSION.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv QUICK_START_NEXT_STEPS.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv CLEANUP_PLAN*.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv CODEBASE_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PLAN.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv DEPLOYMENT_*.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_PLAN.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv REORGANIZATION_CHECKLIST.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv QUICK_START_GUIDE.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv PLAYWRIGHT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md docs/archived/completed-tasks/
mv CASCADE_LLM_ONBOARDING.md docs/archived/completed-tasks/
mv MARKETING_PRIMER_SAASTASTIC.md docs/archived/completed-tasks/
```

### **Step 2: Create Missing Customer Docs** (30 min - OPTIONAL)

**Already complete**:
- ✅ **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Already created! 951 lines covering setup, deployment, and troubleshooting

**Optional to create**:

1. **FAQ.md** (30 min):
   > "Create an FAQ at `docs/guides/FAQ.md` for SaaStastic. Cover: 1) What services do I need? (Clerk, Stripe, DB), 2) Can I use alternatives? (Yes for optional services), 3) What's included? (All features, no holdbacks), 4) How do updates work? (Git pull), 5) What support do I get? (Depends on tier), 6) Can I customize? (Yes, it's your code), 7) Multi-project use? (Depends on license tier), 8) Refund policy? (30 days). Keep answers short and clear."

**Note**: SETUP_GUIDE.md already includes an extensive troubleshooting section (8 common issues with solutions), so a separate TROUBLESHOOTING.md isn't necessary.

### **Step 3: Update README.md** (30 min)

**Ask Cascade**:
> "Update the root README.md for SaaStastic. Make it focused on SELLING the boilerplate (not demoing an app). Structure: 1) Hero (what it is, who it's for, key value prop), 2) Features (29 permissions, RBAC, multi-tenant, Stripe, Clerk, etc.), 3) Tech stack showcase, 4) Quick start for customers, 5) Documentation links, 6) Pricing tiers summary with link, 7) Purchase CTA. Make it convert GitHub visitors to buyers. Professional and founder-friendly tone."

### **Step 4: Read MASTER_LAUNCH_PLAN.md** (30 min)

- Read the entire plan
- Understand the 7-day timeline
- Note the AI prompts included
- Block out 7 days on your calendar

### **Step 5: Start Day 1!** 🚀

Open `MASTER_LAUNCH_PLAN.md` and start checking boxes at **Day 1, Task 1.1**
