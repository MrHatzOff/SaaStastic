# Session Notes (2025-08-20)

## What We Worked On
- Finishing touches and bug fixes for the repo
- Adding/Splitting the windsurf rules files by Activation Type
- Trying to get the Development mode Company switcher to work
- Trying to get Company, customer and user CRUD to work properly in development mode

## Problems Encountered
- Still often going to clerk login page while in dev mode
- Company, customer and user CRUD not working properly in development mode
- Network errors when trying to add/update companies

## Where We Left Off
- Boilerplate repo appears to be getting close, but we need to finish the development mode company switcher and get the Company, customer and user CRUD working properly in development mode
- Finish setting up windsurf rules
- Create an End of Session Housekeeping workflow to trigger cascade to update certain/specific documentation files, Create a session notes file, "YYYY-MM-DD.md" in the /docs/notes folder with the Headings and notes from the day's session.
- Polishing and testing the app at this point.  Full functionality is and testing complete before marking the repo as "ready for production"

## Next Session Priorities
- Fix Company, customer and user CRUD in development mode
- Fix Clerk login in development mode, maybe done already
- Fix Network errors when trying to add/update companies
- Start testing,  Tenant isolation, Company isolation, User isolation, Customer isolation, etc
- Finish setting up the docs from TEMPLATES.md or other system.
