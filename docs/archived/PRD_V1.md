# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Complete Multi-Tenant B2B SaaS Boilerplate

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for transforming the existing Next.js SaaS boilerplate into a production-ready, comprehensive multi-tenant B2B SaaS starter kit. The goal is to create a complete foundation that handles the entire customer lifecycle from marketing and acquisition to ongoing customer support and operations.

The current codebase has solid foundations with multi-tenant authentication, basic CRUD operations, and marketing pages. This PRD outlines the missing components needed to create a truly production-ready starter that allows developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.

## Goals

1. **Complete Customer Lifecycle Coverage**: Provide infrastructure for marketing, sales, onboarding, application usage, billing, and customer support
2. **Production-Ready Security**: Implement comprehensive security measures including tenant isolation, audit trails, and access controls
3. **Operational Excellence**: Include monitoring, alerting, backup, and disaster recovery capabilities
4. **Developer Experience**: Create clear documentation and examples that enable junior developers to extend the system
5. **Scalability**: Design architecture to support thousands of tenants with high performance
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Prioritize free and open-source solutions where they meet requirements
