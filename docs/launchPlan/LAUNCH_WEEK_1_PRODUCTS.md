2. AI-optimized development (UNIQUE - no competitor has this)
3. $296 bonus value included (limited time)
4. 2-3 week timeline to first sale
5. Proven pricing model

**Most founders would**:
- Spend 3-6 months building this
- Launch with all 7 products (2+ hours)
- Not include bonus content
- Not have AI-specific guides
- Take 6-12 months to first sale

**You're doing it in 2-3 weeks with a better product!**

**Launch Week 1 with**: Starter + Pro (+ optional Support 5hr)  
**Setup time**: 30-35 minutes  
**Add others**: Week 2+ when needed (15 min each)

**This is the smart, lean, fast approach.**

Stop overthinking. Launch with 2-3 products. Make your first sales. Add higher tiers when customers ask for them.
