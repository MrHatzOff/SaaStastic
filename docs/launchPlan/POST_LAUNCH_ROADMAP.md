# 📈 POST-LAUNCH ROADMAP

**Status**: ACTIVE - Extends beyond launch day  
**Purpose**: Guide feature development based on customer demand  
**Philosophy**: Build what customers actually need, not what we think they need

---

## 🎯 Overview

This roadmap covers features that are **NOT required for launch** but add value as your customer base grows.

**Rule**: Don't build these until you have **demand signals**:
- 5+ support requests for same feature
- Customer explicitly requests it
- Blocking a sale ($5k+ customer needs it)

---

## 📅 WEEK 2-4: Monitor & Iterate

**Goal**: Learn what customers actually need  
**Time**: 2-4 hours/week

### Week 2: First Customer Feedback

  - "How's setup going?"
  - "What's confusing?"
  - "What would make this better?"

- [ ] **Monitor support channels** (1 hour/day)
  - Discord #starter-help, #professional-help
  - support@saastastic.com inbox

## 📊 MONTH 2: Scale & Optional Admin Features

**Trigger**: 20-30 customers, starting to get support volume  
**Goal**: Decide if admin portal is worth building

### Customer Support Analysis

**Before building anything, measure**:

Current support setup:
- ✅ Clerk dashboard (user management)
- ✅ Prisma Studio (database access)
- ✅ Stripe dashboard (billing)
- ✅ Email support
- ✅ Discord community

**Track these metrics** (Week 5-8):
- How many support requests per week?
- Average time to resolve?
- What % need database access?
- What % need user impersonation?
- What % are simple billing questions?

**Decision Matrix**:

| Support Requests/Week | Action |
|----------------------|--------|
| < 5 requests | ✅ Keep current setup |
| 5-15 requests | 🟡 Consider admin dashboard |
| 15+ requests | 🔴 Build admin portal NOW |

---

### Optional: Admin Support Portal (If Needed)

**ONLY BUILD IF**: Support volume justifies it (15+ requests/week)

**Time to Build**: 2-3 weeks (40-60 hours)

#### Phase 1: Basic Admin Dashboard (Week 1)

**Features**:
- [ ] Admin-only route with auth check (2 hours)
- [ ] Company search and list view (4 hours)
- [ ] User list with company filter (3 hours)
- [ ] Subscription status view (3 hours)
- [ ] Quick stats dashboard (3 hours)

**Files to Create**:
```
src/app/(admin)/
├── layout.tsx                  # Admin auth guard
├── dashboard/page.tsx          # Stats overview
├── companies/page.tsx          # Company list/search
└── users/page.tsx              # User management
```

**AI Prompt for layout.tsx**:
```
Create an admin-only layout at src/app/(admin)/layout.tsx that:
1. Checks if current user email is in ADMIN_EMAILS env variable
2. Redirects non-admins to /dashboard with error toast
3. Shows admin nav sidebar with: Dashboard, Companies, Users, Analytics
4. Uses consistent styling with main app
5. Includes "Exit Admin Mode" button

Use Clerk's useUser() hook and protect route.
```

---

#### Phase 2: Safe Impersonation (Week 2)

**⚠️ SECURITY CRITICAL**

**Features**:
- [ ] Temporary impersonation sessions (8 hours)
- [ ] Audit log for every impersonation (3 hours)
- [ ] Auto-expire after 1 hour (2 hours)
- [ ] Limited permissions during impersonation (4 hours)
- [ ] Banner showing "Impersonating [Company]" (2 hours)

**Files to Create**:
```
src/app/(admin)/impersonate/
├── page.tsx                    # Company selection
└── [companyId]/page.tsx        # Active session

src/core/support/
├── impersonation-service.ts    # Session management
└── audit-logger.ts             # Impersonation logs
```

**Security Requirements**:
1. Never allow financial actions while impersonating
2. Log every action taken during session
3. Require re-authentication to start session
4. Email company owner when impersonation starts/ends
5. Automatic session termination after 1 hour

---

#### Phase 3: Analytics Dashboard (Week 3)

**Features**:
- [ ] System health metrics (4 hours)
- [ ] User engagement tracking (4 hours)
- [ ] Revenue analytics (3 hours)
- [ ] Error rate monitoring (3 hours)
- [ ] API performance metrics (3 hours)

**Integration**:
- Use existing audit logs
- Query Stripe for revenue data
- Monitor error tracking from Sentry
- Database query performance

---

### Cost/Benefit Analysis

**Cost to Build Admin Portal**:
- Development time: 40-60 hours
- Testing time: 10 hours
- Documentation: 3-4 hours
- **Total**: ~55-75 hours

**Benefit**:
- Reduce support time by 50% (if handling 15+ requests/week)
- Faster issue resolution (customer happiness)
- Scale support without hiring

**Break-Even**:
- If you value your time at $100/hr: Portal saves $5-10k/year
- ONLY worth it if support volume justifies it

**Recommendation**: Wait until Month 2 to decide based on actual data

---

## 🎫 MONTH 3: Support Ticketing (Optional)

**Trigger**: 50+ customers, support volume too high for email  
**Goal**: Centralized ticket management

### Should You Build or Buy?

**Buy (Recommended)**:
- **Intercom**: $74/month (free 14-day trial)
  - In-app messenger
  - Email integration
  - Knowledge base
  - Ticket management
- **Zendesk**: $55/month
  - Robust ticketing
  - Multi-channel support
- **Plain**: $29/month
  - Built for SaaS
  - API-first

**Build Custom** (Only if):
- You have very specific workflow needs
- You want tight product integration
- You plan to charge for support access

### If Building Custom (40-50 hours)

**Features**:
```
- Ticket creation (email-to-ticket)
- Ticket assignment (manual/auto)
- Status tracking (open/pending/closed)
- Priority levels
- Internal notes
- Customer notifications
- SLA tracking (Enterprise tier)
```

**Files to Create**:
```
src/features/support/
├── components/
│   ├── ticket-list.tsx
│   ├── ticket-detail.tsx
│   └── ticket-form.tsx
├── services/
│   ├── ticket-service.ts
│   └── email-to-ticket.ts
└── types/
    └── ticket-types.ts

prisma/schema.prisma:
model SupportTicket {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  companyId   String
  userId      String?
  email       String
  subject     String
  status      TicketStatus
  priority    TicketPriority
  assignedTo  String?
  messages    TicketMessage[]
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

**Recommendation**: Start with Intercom ($74/month). Only build if Intercom doesn't meet needs after 3 months.

**ROI Calculation**:
- Cost to build: 50 hours × $100 = $5,000
- Cost to buy: $74/month × 12 = $888/year
- **Savings**: $4,112 in Year 1 by buying

---

---

## 📋 Decision Framework

For any new feature request, ask:

### 1. Validation Questions
- [ ] How many customers have requested this?
- [ ] Would they pay extra for it?
- [ ] Can they work around it currently?
- [ ] Is there a "buy" option instead of "build"?

### 2. Build vs. Buy Calculator
```
Build Cost = (Hours to build × Your hourly rate) + (Maintenance hours/year × Rate)
Buy Cost = (Monthly fee × 12) + (Setup fee)

If Build Cost > 3× Buy Cost → BUY
If Build Cost < Buy Cost → BUILD
If in between → Depends on strategic value
```

### 3. Priority Matrix

| Urgency | Customer Demand | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| High | High (5+ requests) | **Build in 2 weeks** |
| High | Low (1-2 requests) | **Find workaround** |
| Low | High (5+ requests) | **Add to roadmap (4-6 weeks)** |
| Low | Low | **Archive for now** |

## 🔄 Quarterly Review Process

Every 3 months, review:

1. **What features did we build?** Why?
2. **What features did we skip?** Why?
3. **What did customers actually use?**
4. **What feedback are we getting?**
5. **What should we focus on next quarter?**

**Template**:
```markdown
# Q[X] 2025 Review

## Features Shipped
- [Feature Name] - [Hours spent] - [Usage: X customers]

## Features Skipped
- [Feature Name] - [Why we skipped]

## Key Learnings
- [Learning 1]
- [Learning 2]

## Next Quarter Focus
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]
```

## 🎉 Remember

**Core Philosophy**: 
> "Don't build features customers don't need. Listen, validate, then build."

**Your competitive advantage is**:
- Fast iteration
- Direct customer communication
- Willingness to build what they actually need

**Not**:
- Having every feature
- Being like the competition
- Building for hypothetical customers

---

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Complete PRE_LAUNCH_CRITICAL_TASKS.md
2. ✅ Execute MASTER_LAUNCH_PLAN.md (Days 1-7)
3. 📊 Track metrics Week 2-4
4. 🎯 Build based on actual demand, not this roadmap

This roadmap is a guide, not a prescription. **Build what your customers need, when they need it.** 🚀
