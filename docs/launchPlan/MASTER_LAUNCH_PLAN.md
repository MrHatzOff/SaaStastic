## üéØ Bonus Content Strategy Decision

**Decision Point**: How to monetize bonus content (AI Dev Tasks + LaunchKit)?

### **Option 1: Included in Tiers** (Simplest)
- Pro+: Get AI Workflow Toolkit
- Agency+: Get both toolkits
- **Pros**: Higher perceived value, simpler
- **Cons**: Less additional revenue

### **Option 2: Add-On Products Only** (Maximum Revenue)
- All tiers can purchase separately
- **Pros**: Extra revenue stream, flexible pricing
- **Cons**: More complex, may fragment customers

### **Option 3: Hybrid** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
- **Starter**: Can purchase as add-ons ($99, $197, $247 bundle)
- **Professional**: Includes AI Workflow Toolkit ($99 value)
- **Agency+**: Includes both toolkits ($296 value)
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, upsell opportunity for Starter, premium feel for higher tiers
- **Cons**: Slightly more complex delivery logic

**Recommended Choice**: Option 3 (Hybrid)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In webhook handler
if (tier === 'STARTER') {
  // Base product only
  // Show add-on options in welcome email
} else if (tier === 'PRO') {
  // Include AI Workflow Toolkit
  includeBonus('ai-dev-tasks');
} else if (['AGENCY', 'ENTERPRISE', 'FOREVER'].includes(tier)) {
  // Include both toolkits
  includeBonus('ai-dev-tasks');
  includeBonus('launch-kit');
}
```
