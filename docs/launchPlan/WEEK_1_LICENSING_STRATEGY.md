# 🔑 Week 1 Licensing Strategy - Manual Process

**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Purpose**: Clear guide for handling licenses Week 1 (manual) vs Week 2+ (automated)

---

## 🎯 Your Question Answered

**Q: "Do I need to run a local stable version for licensing?"**  
**A: NO! ❌ You don't need ANY version running for Week 1.**

**Why**:
- Week 1 = Manual delivery (ZIP + manual GitHub invites)
- Lemon Squeezy handles everything except GitHub invites
- No automation code needed yet
- No database queries needed yet
- No license validation needed yet

---

## ✅ What You Already Have

### **Database Schema** - COMPLETE
```
✅ LicenseCustomer model (created Oct 9, 2025)
✅ All necessary fields for Lemon Squeezy tracking
✅ Just added: lemonSqueezyLicenseKey field
✅ SupportSession model for support hour tracking
✅ Migration ready to run
```

### **Documentation** - COMPLETE
```
✅ LICENSING_SYSTEM.md (planning doc)
✅ LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md (customer license terms)
✅ Schema designed and tested
```

### **What's NOT Built** - Week 2 Tasks
```
❌ Webhook handler (no code yet)
❌ License key generator (no code yet)
❌ GitHub automation (no code yet)
❌ Welcome email automation (no code yet)
❌ License validation API (no code yet)
```

**This is PERFECT for Week 1!** You launch manually, build automation Week 2.

## 📋 Week 1: Manual Licensing Process (NO CODE NEEDED)

### **How It Works Without Automation**

**1. Customer Purchases on Lemon Squeezy** ✅ Automatic
```
Customer clicks "Buy Now" → Pays → Done
```

**2. Lemon Squeezy Does Automatically** ✅ No work for you
```
✅ Generates license key (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX)
✅ Sends email to customer with:
   • License key
   • ZIP download link
   • Receipt
✅ Sends "New Order" notification to you
```

**3. Customer Downloads ZIP** ✅ Automatic
```
Customer clicks download → Gets saastastic-dist.zip → Extracts → Uses
```

**4. You Do Manually** (5 minutes per sale, once per day)
```
Check Lemon Squeezy dashboard → See new orders → Invite to GitHub
```

**Total automation**: 95%  
**Your manual work**: 5 minutes/day (batch GitHub invites)

---

## 📊 Week 1 Tracking: Two Options

### **Option 1: Just Use Lemon Squeezy Dashboard** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Simplest approach** - everything already there:

1. **View Orders**: LS Dashboard → Orders
2. **See Customer Info**:
   - Email
   - Tier purchased
   - License key (LS generated)
   - Custom fields (GitHub username if provided)
   - Purchase date
3. **Filter & Search**: LS has built-in filters
4. **Export**: Can export to CSV anytime

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero setup
- ✅ Already built
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No maintenance

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Have to check LS dashboard (not your own system)

---

### **Option 2: Simple Spreadsheet** (if you prefer)

**Track in Google Sheets or Excel**:

| Email            | Tier  | LS Key      | GitHub User | Invited | Purchase Date |
|------------------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| john@example.com | START | 1A2B-3C4D.. | johndoe     | ✅ 10/14| Oct 14, 2025  |
| jane@company.com | PRO   | 2B3C-4D5E.. | janecoder   | ✅ 10/14| Oct 14, 2025  |

**When to use**:
- You like spreadsheets
- Want offline access
- Need custom tracking fields

**Pros**:
- ✅ Flexible
- ✅ Offline access
- ✅ Custom fields

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Manual entry
- ⚠️ Duplicate data (LS already has this)

---

### **Option 3: Add to Your Database** (Week 2+)

**After you build the webhook**, automatically add to database:

```typescript
// Week 2 webhook will do this automatically
await db.licenseCustomer.create({
  data: {
    email: order.customer.email,
    tier: getTierFromProduct(order.product_id),
    lemonSqueezyLicenseKey: order.license_key,  // NEW field we just added
    licenseKey: generateCustomKey(),  // Your custom key
    lemonSqueezyOrderId: order.id,
    purchaseDate: new Date(order.created_at),
    // ... rest of fields
  }
});
```

**When to do this**: Week 2, after you build webhook (Day 2 tasks)

---

## 🔧 Pre-Launch Setup: Update Database Schema

### **Run Migration** (5 minutes)

I just added `lemonSqueezyLicenseKey` field to your schema. Run migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_lemonsqueezy_license_key
```

This adds the field so when you build the webhook (Week 2), you can store both keys:
- `licenseKey` - Your custom key (SAAS-STARTER-ABC123-XYZ)
- `lemonSqueezyLicenseKey` - LS auto-generated key (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX)

**Why both**:
- LS key = Quick validation via LS API
- Custom key = Your project-specific features (1 project limit, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Week 1 Launch Workflow

### **Daily Routine** (10 minutes total)

**Morning** (5 min):
1. Check email for "New Order" notifications from Lemon Squeezy
2. Or: Open LS Dashboard → Orders → Filter by "Last 24 hours"
3. Count new sales (celebrate! 🎉)

**Evening** (5 min):
1. Open LS Dashboard → Orders → Today's orders
2. For each order with GitHub username:
   - Copy GitHub username
   - Go to your private repo → Settings → Manage access
   - Invite collaborator → Paste username → Set "Read" permission
   - Click "Invite"
3. Done!

**That's it.** No code, no servers, no complexity.

---

## 📧 Manual GitHub Invite Process

### **Step-by-Step**

1. **Get Customer's GitHub Username**:
   - LS Dashboard → Order → View Details
   - See "GitHub Username (optional)" field
   - If empty: Skip (they didn't provide one, or they'll email later)

2. **Invite to Private Repo**:
   ```
   GitHub.com → Your Repo → Settings → Collaborators
   → "Add people" → Enter username → "Read" access → Send invite
   ```

3. **Send Follow-Up Email** (optional, nice touch):
   ```
   Subject: 🎉 Your SaaStastic GitHub Access is Ready!
   
   Hi [Name],
   
   I've invited [github-username] to the private SaaStastic repository.
   
   ✅ Check your GitHub notifications
   ✅ Accept the invitation
   ✅ Clone: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saastastic-private.git
   
   You already have the ZIP download, but GitHub gives you:
   • Pull updates anytime (12 months included)
   • Easy version switching
   • Clone to multiple machines
   
   Happy building!
   [Your Name]
   ```

4. **Track Invites** (optional):
   - Check "Invited" box in spreadsheet
   - Or: Note in LS order (LS has notes field)

---

## 🤔 Common Questions

### **Q: What if someone doesn't provide GitHub username?**
**A**: That's fine! They have the ZIP. They can:
- Email you later with their username
- Buy without GitHub access (ZIP is enough)
- You can add them anytime

### **Q: Do I need a separate app/server running?**
**A**: NO! Week 1 is fully manual. No servers needed.

### **Q: What about license validation?**
**A**: Week 1 = honor system. They paid, they get code. Week 2+ you build validation API.

### **Q: Can I sell without the database set up?**
**A**: YES! LS handles sales. Your database is for Week 2 automation (optional for Week 1).

### **Q: Should I track manually in database Week 1?**
**A**: Not necessary. Use LS dashboard. Add to database Week 2 when webhook runs.

### **Q: What if I get 10 sales in one day?**
**A**: Takes 10 minutes to invite all (1 min each). Or wait until evening and batch them.

## 📅 Week 2: Automation Timeline

### **When to Build Automation**

**Trigger**: After 5-10 sales  
**Why**: Proven product-market fit, worth the investment

**What to Build** (Day 2-3, ~6 hours):

**Day 2 Morning** (3 hours):
1. ✅ Create Prisma migration (schema already ready)
2. ✅ Create license key generator
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/licensing/license-generator.ts
   function generateLicenseKey(tier: string, customerId: string) {
     // Format: SAAS-STARTER-ABC123-XYZ789
   }
   ```

**Day 2 Afternoon** (3 hours):
3. ✅ Create Lemon Squeezy webhook handler
   ```typescript
   // src/app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts
   export async function POST(request: Request) {
     // Verify webhook signature
     // Extract order data
     // Create LicenseCustomer record
     // Invite to GitHub (Octokit)
     // Send welcome email
   }
   ```

**Day 3 Morning** (2 hours):
4. ✅ Test webhook end-to-end
5. ✅ Set webhook URL in LS dashboard
6. ✅ Make test purchase, verify automation works

**Day 3 Afternoon** (2 hours):
7. ✅ Backfill existing customers into database
8. ✅ Send existing customers welcome email with GitHub info

**Total Time**: 6-8 hours over 2-3 days

## 🎉 Bottom Line

### **Week 1 Strategy**:
```
✅ NO servers running
✅ NO automation code needed
✅ NO database queries needed
✅ Just Lemon Squeezy + Manual GitHub invites
✅ 95% automated (LS), 5% manual (you)
✅ Launch TODAY, automate Week 2
```

### **You Asked**:
> "Do I need to run a local stable version for licensing?"

**Answer**: 
**NO!** You don't need any version of your app running for Week 1. Your SaaStastic app is what CUSTOMERS build with your boilerplate. You're selling the code, not running a SaaS service.

**Week 1**: Lemon Squeezy handles sales, you handle GitHub invites manually  
**Week 2**: Build webhook to automate everything  
**Week 3+**: Fully automated, zero manual work

### **You Asked**:
> "If building automation is supposed to be done prior to launching, do we need to do anything more?"

**Answer**:
**NO!** Automation is NOT required for launch. It's a Week 2 optimization.

**What's required**:
- ✅ Lemon Squeezy products created ← Do this
- ✅ ZIP uploaded ← Do this
- ✅ Run migration ← Do this (5 min)
- ❌ Webhook automation ← Week 2 (optional for launch)

**Launch checklist**:
1. ✅ Run: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_lemonsqueezy_license_key`
2. ✅ Create LS products (Starter, Pro)
3. ✅ Upload ZIP to LS
4. ✅ Publish products
5. 🚀 **LAUNCH!**

Everything else is Week 2 optimization!

**You're ready to launch with manual licensing. Automate when you have traction!** 🚀
