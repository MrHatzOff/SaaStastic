### Step 2: Archive Old Docs (10 minutes - OPTIONAL)

If you want to clean up (optional but recommended):

```powershell
# Create archive directories COMPLETED [‚úÖ]
mkdir -p docs/archived/session-summaries
mkdir -p docs/archived/old-plans
mkdir -p docs/archived/completed-tasks

# Move old files (copy-paste entire block) COMPLETED [‚úÖ]
mv AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv SESSION_SUMMARY*.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv TEST_*.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_OCT_6_2025.md docs/archived/session-summaries/
mv CLEANUP_PLAN*.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv CODEBASE_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv DEPLOYMENT_*.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md docs/archived/old-plans/
mv PLAYWRIGHT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md docs/archived/completed-tasks/
```
Still way too many markdown files in root directory, in docs/, in docs/core/...  Please evaluate and recommend what files should go where, archiving (in docs/archived/*/) and organizing the documentation files clearly into our file structure.

- Day 3: Support infrastructure

## üìä What Was Discovered in This Session

### Feature Gap Analysis

**Original Vision** (from old planning docs):
- ‚úÖ RBAC system ‚Üí **FULLY BUILT**
- ‚úÖ Team management ‚Üí **FULLY BUILT**
- ‚úÖ Billing integration ‚Üí **MOSTLY BUILT** (missing portal + emails)
- ‚ùå Admin support portal ‚Üí **NOT BUILT** (not needed for launch)
- ‚ùå Support ticketing ‚Üí **NOT BUILT** (buy later if needed)
- ‚ùå Safe impersonation ‚Üí **NOT BUILT** (post-launch if needed)

**Decision**: Launch without admin portal/ticketing
- Use Clerk + Prisma Studio + Stripe dashboard for support
- Only 2-3 support requests expected Week 1
- Build admin features when you have 50+ customers and 15+ requests/week

**Savings**: ~60-80 hours of development time

---

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. You're More Ready Than You Thought
- Product is 95% complete
- Missing features are nice-to-haves, not must-haves
- 6-8 hours from launch-ready

### 2. Original Plan Was Comprehensive
- You envisioned admin portal, ticketing, impersonation
- Those are operational tools for YOU, not product features
- Build them when customer volume justifies it

### 3. Smart Launch Strategy
- Launch with core features first
- Monitor what customers actually need
- Build based on demand, not assumptions

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Week 1 (Launch)
- [ ] 5-10 sales = $2k-$5k revenue
- [ ] Zero technical issues
- [ ] First testimonial collected

### Month 2
- [ ] 30-50 customers
- [ ] Decide if admin portal is needed (based on support volume)
