## üéØ The Three Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Included in All Tiers**

**What it means**:
- Every customer (Starter to Forever) gets both bonus toolkits
- No additional products to create
- Simplest delivery

**Pricing stays the same**:
- Starter: $399 (includes $296 bonus value)
- Professional: $997 (includes $296 bonus value)
- Agency: $4,997 (includes $296 bonus value)
- Enterprise: $9,997/year (includes $296 bonus value)
- Forever: $20,000 (includes $296 bonus value)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Simplest to implement (no extra products)
- ‚úÖ Highest perceived value ("Wow, I get all this!")
- ‚úÖ Easy messaging ("Everything included")
- ‚úÖ No delivery logic needed (everyone gets same package)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå No additional revenue opportunity
- ‚ùå Starter tier gets same bonuses as Forever tier (feels less premium for high tiers)
- ‚ùå Can't use bonuses as upsells

**When to choose**:
- You want to launch FAST (this week)
- You don't want complexity
- You value simplicity over optimization
- Your pricing is already competitive

---

### **Strategy 2: Add-On Products Only**

**What it means**:
- Base tiers include NO bonus content
- Customers purchase bonuses separately
- 3 additional products in Lemon Squeezy

**Pricing structure**:
- Core tiers: $399, $997, $4,997, $9,997/yr, $20,000 (unchanged)
- **NEW**: AI Workflow Toolkit ($99)
- **NEW**: Launch Success Kit ($197)
- **NEW**: Complete Bonus Bundle ($247, save $50)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Maximum revenue potential (+$15k-$30k/year)
- ‚úÖ Flexible for customers (buy what they need)
- ‚úÖ Can adjust pricing independently
- ‚úÖ Clear upsell path
- ‚úÖ Can run promotions on add-ons

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå More products to manage (10 total vs 7)
- ‚ùå More complex delivery logic
- ‚ùå May feel "nickel and dimed" to customers
- ‚ùå Fragments customer base (who has what?)
- ‚ùå More support questions ("How do I get bonus X?")

**Revenue Projection** (100 customers):
- Base revenue: $173,268
- 30% buy AI Toolkit (+$2,970)
- 20% buy Launch Kit (+$3,940)
- 10% buy Bundle (+$2,470)
- **Total bonus revenue**: +$9,380
- **Grand total**: $182,648 (+5.4% increase)

**When to choose**:
- Revenue optimization is priority
- You have time for complexity
- You're comfortable with more products
- Your pricing is on the lower end

---

### **Strategy 3: Hybrid** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

**What it means**:
- **Starter**: Base product only, can purchase bonuses as add-ons
- **Professional**: Includes AI Workflow Toolkit ($99 value)
- **Agency**: Includes both toolkits ($296 value)
- **Enterprise**: Includes both + priority updates
- **Forever**: Includes both + white-glove service

**Why this works**:
- Starter customers can upgrade their experience
- Higher tiers feel premium (included bonuses)
- Creates natural upsell path (Starter ‚Üí Pro)
- Balances simplicity and revenue

**Products in Lemon Squeezy**:
1-7: Core tiers (same as before)
8-10: Optional add-ons (for Starter customers)

**Delivery Logic**:
```typescript
if (tier === 'STARTER') {
  deliverBaseProduct();
  emailUpsellOptions(); // Show add-on options
} else if (tier === 'PRO') {
  deliverBaseProduct();
  deliverBonus('ai-dev-tasks');
  emailBonusIncluded('AI Workflow Toolkit');
} else if (['AGENCY', 'ENTERPRISE', 'FOREVER'].includes(tier)) {
  deliverBaseProduct();
  deliverBonus('ai-dev-tasks');
  deliverBonus('launch-kit');
  emailBonusIncluded('Both toolkits');
}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
- ‚úÖ Natural tier differentiation (Pro+ feels premium)
- ‚úÖ Upsell opportunity (Starter can upgrade)
- ‚úÖ Additional revenue without complexity
- ‚úÖ Clear value proposition per tier
- ‚úÖ Simpler than full add-on strategy

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly more delivery logic (but manageable)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to track who has what (but you already do for tiers)

**Revenue Projection** (100 customers):
- Assume: 45 Starter, 35 Pro, 15 Agency, 5 Enterprise/Forever
- Base revenue: $173,268
- Starter add-ons: 15 customers √ó $99-$247 avg = +$2,200
- Tier upgrades: 10 customers upgrade Starter ‚Üí Pro for bonuses = +$5,980
- **Total bonus impact**: +$8,180
- **Grand total**: $181,448 (+4.7% increase)

**When to choose**:
- You want balance between simplicity and revenue
- You value tier differentiation
- You want natural upsell path
- You're okay with moderate complexity

```
BONUS CONTENT STRATEGY DECISION

Date: ____10/12/2025____________
Chosen Strategy: [x] All Included  [ ] Add-On Only  [ ] Hybrid

Reasoning:
- Priority: ___Simplicity, Free to me or anyone on github (snarktank) and LaunchKit is far from polished nor valuable at this point.___________________
- Complexity tolerance: ______Want to deploy and build as fast as possible, the 5 % increase in revenue is quit negligable for the cost of complexity. I would prefer if anything to offer them free as a intro offer/ additional selling point to help get more quick early sales and traction____________________________
- Target customer: _I am not really sure who the target customer will be and I am not sure if I will be able to sell to them nor if the agency or pro versions will sell at all_____________________________
- Timeline: _______need to be making sales within 2-3 weeks at the most.______________________________________

Implementation Plan:
1. __Use Both bonus plans as marketing strategies for early adopters/purchasers._____________________
2. Bundle as part of the repo for the first 3 months introductory offer.____________________________________________________
3. __After 3 months, we will evaluate if we want to continue offering the bundle as a separate product.____________________________________________________

Review Date: ____12/12/2025____________ (check if we need to pivot)
