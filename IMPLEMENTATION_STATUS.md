### **What Was Removed**

- ❌ `src/core/app/` - Empty placeholder (removed)
- ❌ `src/core/observability/` - Empty placeholder (removed)
- ❌ `src/core/security/` - Empty placeholder (removed)

These were **future placeholders** that were never implemented. Security and observability logic currently exists in:
- Security: Distributed across API middleware, permission guards, and Clerk
- Observability: Using console.log (upgrade to structured logging when needed)

## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: Why isn't Sentry/Resend configured?**  
A: These are **optional** services that add cost. We provide the integration points, but let customers choose their own services or start without them.

**Q: What happened to core/observability and core/security?**  
A: They were empty placeholders. The functionality exists in other places:
- Security: Permission guards, API middleware, Clerk integration
- Observability: Console logging (upgrade to structured logging when scaling)

**Q: Is the app production-ready without email?**  
A: Yes! Email is only needed for:
- User invitations (can add members manually via dashboard)
- Notifications (not critical for MVP)

**Q: When should I add optional services?**  
A: 
- **Email**: When you need invitations to work automatically
- **Error Tracking**: Before scaling (catch issues proactively)
- **Analytics**: After product-market fit (understand user behavior)
- **Advanced Logging**: When debugging production becomes difficult
