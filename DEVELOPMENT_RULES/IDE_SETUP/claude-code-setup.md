## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Rules for Cline

### **Method 1: Custom Instructions (Recommended)**

Cline supports custom instructions that persist across sessions.

1. **Open Cline Settings**
2. **Find "Custom Instructions" section**
3. **Add SaaStastic Rules:**

```markdown
# SaaStastic Development Rules

You are helping develop SaaStastic, a multi-tenant B2B SaaS boilerplate.

## CRITICAL SECURITY RULES (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
   - ALL database queries MUST include: `where: { companyId: context.companyId }`
   - NEVER bypass companyId scoping
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     // ‚ùå WRONG
     await db.customer.findMany()
     
     // ‚úÖ CORRECT
     await db.customer.findMany({ where: { companyId: context.companyId }})
     ```

2. **RBAC Protection**
   - ALL API routes MUST use `withPermissions()` wrapper
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     export const POST = withPermissions(
       async (req, context) => { /* handler */ },
       [PERMISSIONS.FEATURE_CREATE]
     )
     ```

3. **Input Validation**
   - ALL user inputs MUST be validated with Zod schemas
   - NEVER trust client data

4. **Safe Zones**
   - Create new features in: `src/features/custom/`
   - Create new pages in: `src/app/(app)/custom/`
   - Create new APIs in: `src/app/api/custom/`
   - NEVER modify: `src/core/**/*` (core infrastructure)

## Database Model Pattern

```prisma
model YourModel {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  companyId   String   // üîí REQUIRED for multi-tenancy
  
  // Your business fields
  name        String
  
  // Audit trail (best practice)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  createdBy   String?
  updatedBy   String?
  deletedAt   DateTime? // Soft delete
  
  // Relations
  company     Company  @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id])
  
  // Indexes (CRITICAL)
  @@index([companyId])
  @@index([deletedAt])
}
```

## Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- Functions: camelCase (`getUserData`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- Files: kebab-case (`user-utils.ts`)

## TypeScript Rules

- TypeScript strict mode: ALWAYS
- NO `any` types (use `unknown` if truly needed)
- All functions must be properly typed

## Before Generating Code, Verify:

- [ ] Safe zone? (Creating in `src/features/custom/`)
- [ ] Multi-tenant? (All queries include `companyId`)
- [ ] Permissions? (API uses `withPermissions()`)
- [ ] Validation? (Zod schema for inputs)
- [ ] Types? (All TypeScript types defined)

For complete rules, refer to:
- DEVELOPMENT_RULES/architecture.md
- DEVELOPMENT_RULES/coding-standards.md
```

### **Method 2: Workspace Instructions**

Create a file: `.vscode/cline_instructions.md` in your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .vscode
New-Item -ItemType File -Path .vscode/cline_instructions.md
```

Then copy the same content as Method 1 into this file.

---

## üß™ Test the Setup

### **Test 1: Verify Rules Are Active**

Open Cline chat and ask:
```
What are the multi-tenancy rules for this project?
```

Expected: Should mention `companyId` scoping, `withPermissions()`, safe zones

### **Test 2: Code Generation**

Ask Cline:
```
Create a Prisma model for tracking products in inventory.
Follow the project's patterns.
```

Verify the generated model:
‚úÖ Has `companyId` field
‚úÖ Has audit fields
‚úÖ Has proper indexes
‚úÖ Has relation to Company

## üí° Using Cline Effectively

### **Task-Based Development**

Cline excels at breaking down complex tasks:

```
I want to add a complete CRM feature to SaaStastic.

Please:
1. Read DEVELOPMENT_RULES/architecture.md
2. Create database model following multi-tenant pattern
3. Create API routes with proper RBAC
4. Create React components with TypeScript
5. Include tests

Work through this step-by-step, asking for approval at each stage.
```

### **Referencing Files**

Use `@filename` to reference specific files:

```
@architecture.md What's the pattern for API routes?
@UserProfile.tsx Create a similar component for Products
```

### **Mode Selection**

Cline has different modes:

**Ask Mode**: Questions and planning
```
How should I structure a notification system for multi-tenant?
```

**Edit Mode**: File modifications
```
Add error handling to this API route following our patterns
```

**Architect Mode**: Multi-file changes
```
Refactor the customer module to use the new RBAC system
```

---

## üîß Cline-Specific Features

### **Automatic Context**

Cline automatically includes:
- Open files
- Project structure
- Custom instructions
- Recent changes

### **Step-by-Step Execution**

Cline can execute complex tasks autonomously:

```
Create a complete task management feature:

1. Database model with multi-tenant setup
2. API routes (CRUD operations)
3. React components (list, form, card)
4. Permission checks throughout
5. Tests for critical paths

Execute this step-by-step.
```

### **Approval Gates**

Cline asks for approval before:
- Making file changes
- Running commands
- Installing packages

This gives you control while still being efficient.

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Instructions Not Being Followed**

**Problem**: Cline ignores custom instructions

**Solutions**:
1. Verify custom instructions are saved
2. Restart VS Code
3. Reference instructions explicitly: "Follow the rules in custom instructions"
4. Check API key is valid

### **Context Too Large**

**Problem**: "Context window exceeded" error

**Solutions**:
1. Close unnecessary files
2. Break task into smaller pieces
3. Use "Ask" mode for planning before "Edit" mode
4. Clear chat history and start fresh

### **Slow Response Times**

**Problem**: Cline is slow to respond

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify API key has credits
3. Use Claude 3 Haiku for simple tasks (faster)
4. Reduce context size

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### **For New Features**

1. **Planning Phase:**
   ```
   I need to add [FEATURE] to SaaStastic.
   
   First, read our architecture rules and help me plan:
   - Database schema
   - API endpoints needed
   - React components
   - Permission requirements
   ```

2. **Implementation Phase:**
   ```
   Let's implement step-by-step:
   
   Step 1: Create the Prisma model
   [Wait for approval]
   
   Step 2: Create API routes with RBAC
   [Wait for approval]
   
   Step 3: Create React components
   [Wait for approval]
   ```

3. **Review Phase:**
   ```
   Review the code we just created:
   - Does it follow multi-tenant patterns?
   - Are all inputs validated?
   - Are permissions checked?
   - Is TypeScript strict mode compliant?
   ```

### **For Bug Fixes**

```
There's a bug: [describe issue]

Error message: [paste error]

Relevant file: [paste code]

Help me fix this following our patterns.
```

### **For Refactoring**

```
I want to refactor [COMPONENT/MODULE]:

Current state: [describe]
Desired state: [describe]
Constraints: Must follow our architecture rules

Please plan the refactoring before making changes.
```

## üéì Best Practices

### **1. Start with Context**

Begin sessions by giving Cline context:
```
I'm working on the inventory module in SaaStastic.
Read DEVELOPMENT_RULES/architecture.md to understand our patterns.
```

### **2. Reference Existing Code**

```
@CustomerService.ts Create a similar service for Products
```

### **3. Be Specific About Requirements**

```
‚ùå Vague: "Add a feature for notes"

‚úÖ Specific: "Add a notes feature with:
- Multi-tenant isolation
- RBAC protection (Member and above)
- Rich text support
- Full CRUD API following our patterns
- Tests for critical paths"
```

### **4. Review Before Approving**

Always review Cline's proposed changes before approving:
- Check for `companyId` scoping
- Verify permission checks
- Ensure input validation
- Check TypeScript types

### **5. Iterative Improvement**

```
Good start! Now let's improve:
1. Add error handling
2. Add loading states
3. Improve TypeScript types
```
