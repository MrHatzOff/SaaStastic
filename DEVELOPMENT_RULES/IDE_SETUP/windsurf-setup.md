# üåä Windsurf IDE Setup for SaaStastic

**Windsurf** is purpose-built for AI-assisted development with excellent context management and native rule support.

---

## üì¶ Installation

1. Download Windsurf from [https://codeium.com/windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
2. Install for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
3. Open Windsurf IDE
4. Sign in with your account

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Rules

### **Step 1: Create Rules Directory**

In your SaaStastic project root:

```bash
# Create .windsurf directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir .windsurf
mkdir .windsurf\rules
```

### **Step 2: Copy Rule Files**

Copy the development rules to Windsurf's rules directory:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item DEVELOPMENT_RULES\architecture.md .windsurf\rules\
Copy-Item DEVELOPMENT_RULES\coding-standards.md .windsurf\rules\
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux
cp DEVELOPMENT_RULES/architecture.md .windsurf/rules/
cp DEVELOPMENT_RULES/coding-standards.md .windsurf/rules/
```

### **Step 3: Verify Setup**

Your `.windsurf/rules/` directory should contain:
```
.windsurf/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-standards.md
```

### **Step 4: Restart Windsurf**

Close and reopen Windsurf IDE to load the rules.

## üß™ Test the Setup

### **Verify Rules Are Loaded**

1. Open Windsurf chat
2. Ask: "What are the multi-tenancy rules for SaaStastic?"
3. The AI should reference `architecture.md` and mention `companyId` scoping

### **Test Code Generation**

Ask the AI to create a new feature:
```
Create a new database model for tracking products in our inventory.
Follow SaaStastic's multi-tenant patterns.
```

The AI should:
‚úÖ Include `companyId` field
‚úÖ Add proper indexes
‚úÖ Include audit fields
‚úÖ Add relation to Company model

---

## üí° Best Practices

### **Reference Rules Explicitly**

```
"Create this following the API patterns in coding-standards.md"
"Ensure this meets the security requirements in architecture.md"
"Follow the naming conventions from our development rules"
```

### **Context Management**

Windsurf has excellent context awareness. Help it by:
- Mentioning which module you're working in
- Referencing related files
- Being specific about requirements

### **Example Prompts**

**Good Prompt:**
```
I'm adding a CRM module to SaaStastic. Create the database model 
following our multi-tenant patterns from architecture.md. Include 
proper indexes and audit fields.
```

**Even Better:**
```
Create a CRM Contact model in src/features/custom/crm/.

Requirements from architecture.md:
- Multi-tenant with companyId
- Audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy, updatedBy)
- Soft delete with deletedAt
- Proper indexes

Fields needed:
- firstName, lastName, email, phone
- Company relation
```

## üîß Windsurf-Specific Features

### **Flow Mode**

Flow mode in Windsurf allows AI to work autonomously on multi-step tasks.

**Using Flow Mode with Rules:**
1. Start Flow mode (Ctrl/Cmd + L)
2. Give clear instructions referencing rules
3. Let AI work through the task
4. Review and approve changes

**Example:**
```
Use Flow mode to add a complete inventory tracking feature:

1. Read architecture.md and coding-standards.md
2. Create database model with proper multi-tenant setup
3. Create API routes following our patterns
4. Add React components with proper TypeScript
5. Include tests
```

### **Context Window**

Windsurf has a large context window. You can:
- Reference multiple files
- Give detailed instructions
- Include rule files in context

### **Rule Priority**

Windsurf respects rule priority:
- `priority: high` (architecture.md) - Always enforced
- `priority: medium` (coding-standards.md) - Enforced during code review

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Rules Not Being Followed**

**Problem**: AI generates code that doesn't follow rules

**Solutions**:
1. Verify rules are in `.windsurf/rules/` directory
2. Restart Windsurf
3. Explicitly reference rules in prompts
4. Check rule file formatting (must be valid Markdown)

### **Context Not Loading**

**Problem**: AI doesn't seem aware of codebase

**Solutions**:
1. Use `@workspace` to include entire workspace
2. Reference specific files with `@filename`
3. Open relevant files in editor
4. Use "Add to context" feature

### **Generated Code Has Errors**

**Problem**: Code doesn't compile or has TypeScript errors

**Solutions**:
1. Ask AI to fix based on error messages
2. Reference specific rules: "Fix this following coding-standards.md"
3. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and share errors
4. Be more specific about requirements
