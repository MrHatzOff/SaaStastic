## 📖 Code Examples

### **Building with RBAC Protection**

Every feature you build is automatically secured with multi-tenant isolation and permission checks:

```typescript
// src/app/api/projects/route.ts
import { withPermissions, PERMISSIONS } from '@/shared/lib';

// ✅ This endpoint is automatically:
// - Protected by authentication
// - Scoped to user's company (companyId)
// - Checking user has 'project:create' permission
export const POST = withPermissions(
  async (req: NextRequest, context) => {
    const { userId, companyId, permissions } = context;
    const data = await req.json();
    
    // All queries automatically scoped by companyId
    const project = await db.project.create({
      data: {
        ...data,
        companyId, // Required for tenant isolation
        createdBy: userId
      }
    });
    
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true, project });
  },
  [PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_CREATE]
);
```

### **Building Permission-Aware UI**

Show features only to users with appropriate permissions:

```typescript
// src/components/project-dashboard.tsx
import { usePermissions, PermissionGuard } from '@/shared/hooks';

export function ProjectDashboard() {
  const { hasPermission, hasAnyPermission } = usePermissions();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Projects</h1>
      
      {/* Show button only if user can create */}
      <PermissionGuard permission="project:create">
        <CreateProjectButton />
      </PermissionGuard>
      
      {/* Conditional logic */}
      {hasPermission('project:export') && (
        <ExportButton />
      )}
      
      {/* Check multiple permissions */}
      {hasAnyPermission(['project:update', 'project:delete']) && (
        <AdminPanel />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **Adding Custom Permissions**

Extend the system with your own permissions:

```typescript
// src/shared/lib/permissions.ts
export const PERMISSIONS = {
  // Existing permissions...
  
  // Add your custom permissions
  PROJECT_CREATE: 'project:create',
  PROJECT_UPDATE: 'project:update',
  PROJECT_DELETE: 'project:delete',
} as const;

// Update role permissions
export const DEFAULT_ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
  OWNER: [
    ...existingPermissions,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_CREATE,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_UPDATE,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_DELETE,
  ],
  ADMIN: [
    ...existingPermissions,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_CREATE,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_UPDATE,
  ],
  MEMBER: [
    ...existingPermissions,
    PERMISSIONS.PROJECT_CREATE,
  ],
  // ...
};
```

**See the complete guide**: [docs/guides/CUSTOMIZING_PERMISSIONS.md](./docs/guides/CUSTOMIZING_PERMISSIONS.md)

**Philosophy**: 
- `core/` = Stable infrastructure you rarely touch
- `features/` = Where you build your product
- `shared/` = DRY utilities used everywhere

# 2. Import to Vercel
# Visit vercel.com/new and connect your repo

# 3. Add environment variables
# Copy from .env.local to Vercel dashboard

# 4. Deploy!
# Automatic deployments on every push
```

**Why Vercel?**
- ✅ Zero configuration for Next.js
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS

```bash
# Build and deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Runs on your infrastructure
# Full control over everything
```

### **Option 3: VPS** (Ubuntu/Debian)

Traditional deployment to your own server. See our [complete deployment guide](./docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md#step-8-production-deployment).
