## ðŸ”´ Critical Gap #1: Stripe Customer Portal

**Problem**: Customers can't manage their own billing (update card, cancel, view invoices)

**Why It's Critical**: 
- Every SaaS product needs self-service billing
- You'll get support requests about "how do I cancel?" otherwise
- Industry standard feature

### Task 1.1: Add Stripe Customer Portal API Route (1.5 hours)

**File**: `src/app/api/billing/portal/route.ts`

**AI Prompt**:
```
Create a Next.js API route handler for Stripe Customer Portal at src/app/api/billing/portal/route.ts.

Requirements:
1. Import necessary dependencies (stripe, next auth)
2. Use withPermissions middleware to require BILLING_MANAGE permission
3. Get current user's companyId from auth context
4. Query database for company's stripeCustomerId
5. Create Stripe billing portal session with:
   - customer: stripeCustomerId
   - return_url: ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/dashboard/billing
6. Return JSON with {url: session.url}
7. Handle errors if company has no Stripe customer

Use existing patterns from src/features/billing/services/stripe-service.ts.
```

**Manual Steps**:
1. Test the API route: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/billing/portal -X POST`
2. Verify it returns a Stripe portal URL
3. Visit the URL and verify it shows billing management

---

### Task 1.2: Add "Manage Billing" Button (30 min)

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/billing/page.tsx`

**Changes Needed**:
1. Add button after subscription card
2. Button onClick calls: `window.location.href = '/api/billing/portal'`
3. Add loading state during redirect
4. Add permission guard (only OWNER/ADMIN see button)

**AI Prompt**:
```
Update src/app/dashboard/billing/page.tsx to add a "Manage Billing" button.

Add after the SubscriptionCard component (around line 117):
- Button text: "Manage Subscription"
- On click: calls /api/billing/portal POST endpoint
- Shows loading spinner while redirecting
- Only visible if user has BILLING_MANAGE permission (use PermissionGuard)
- Use shadcn/ui Button component
- Style: primary button with external link icon

Follow existing patterns in the file.
```

---

### Task 1.3: Update Billing Service (30 min)

**File**: `src/features/billing/services/stripe-service.ts`

**Add Function**:
```typescript
export async function createCustomerPortalSession(customerId: string, returnUrl: string) {
  const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
    customer: customerId,
    return_url: returnUrl,
  });
  return session;
}
```

**Test**: Verify function works by calling it directly

- [ ] Can update payment method
- [ ] Can view invoice history

---

## ðŸ”´ Critical Gap #2: Billing Notification Emails

**Problem**: Customers don't get notified when:
- Payment fails
- Subscription renews
- Subscription is cancelled

**Why It's Critical**:
- Payment failures need immediate action
- Professional SaaS sends transactional emails
- Reduces support requests

### Task 2.1: Create Email Templates (1.5 hours)

**Create 3 Templates**:

#### Template 1: Payment Failed
**File**: `src/features/billing/email-templates/payment-failed.tsx`

**File**: `src/features/billing/email-templates/payment-successful.tsx`

Use @react-email/components.

Include:

- Access continues until [end date]
- Data export available (link)
- Feedback form link (optional)
- Re-subscribe option if they change mind
- Warm but understanding tone

```

### Task 2.2: Update Stripe Webhook Handler (1.5 hours)

**File**: `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**AI Prompt**:
```
Update the Stripe webhook handler at src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts to send email notifications.

Add email sending for these events:
1. invoice.payment_failed - send payment-failed template
2. invoice.payment_succeeded - send payment-successful template
3. customer.subscription.deleted - send subscription-cancelled template

For each event:
1. Get customer email from database using stripeCustomerId
2. Get subscription details
3. Call Resend API to send appropriate template
4. Log success/failure
5. Handle errors gracefully (don't fail webhook)

Use existing Resend setup from invitation-service.ts as reference.
```

**Manual Steps**:
1. Add Resend imports
2. Install @react-email/components if not installed: `npm install @react-email/components`
3. Test each webhook event in Stripe test mode
